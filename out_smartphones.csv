2L2Y6MI7DFT3,Refurbished - Motorola V860 Barrage Cellphone for Verizon - V860-Verizon-B Stock,"Motorola V860 Barrage Cellphone for Verizon - V860-Verizon-B StockRefurbished -Motorola V860 Barrage Cellphone for Verizon - V860-Verizon-B StockTo keep the Barrage waterproof, the battery cover uses a locking mechanism at its bottom end. Moto doesn't include a tool in the box, so you'll need a coin or a sharp fingernail to get it off, but it's an easy process. The microSD card slot is located behind the cover (you don't need to remove the battery, too). Normally we'd disapprove of such an arrangement, but we get the need for it on a phone that can go swimming. Indeed, we gave the Barrage a full bath and it kept on ticking. The menu interface is available in three designs, and each allows for a degree of customization. The Barrage navigation array is spacious and comfortable. There's a four-way toggle with a central OK button, two soft keys, a clear button, a camera shortcut, and the Talk and End/power keys. All keys are tactile and you can designate shortcuts for the toggle. They keypad buttons are equally satisfying. We could dial and text quickly and we could use the keys by feel. The backlighting is bright and the numbers on the keys are large. Features The Barrage has a 1,000-contact phone book with room in each entry for five phone numbers, two e-mail addresses, a street address and notes. You can save contacts to groups and assign them a photo and one of 12 polyphonic ringtones. PTT numbers are stored in a separate phone book; you can assign each contact an alert tone and organize them in groups.
