5H5DQHAVZ8LD,"Apple MacBook Air 11.6-Inch laptop(1.6 GHz Intel i5, 128 GB SSD, Integrated Intel HD Graphics 6000, Mac OS X Yosemite) - MJVM2LL/A (Manufacture Refurbished)","We aim to show you accurate product information. Manufacturers, suppliers and others provide what you see here, and we have not verified it. See our disclaimerThe 11.6"" MacBook Air Notebook Computer (Early 2015) from Apple is an ultraportable notebook computer with a thin and lightweight design. Apple's engineers have leveraged the lessons they learned in designing the miniaturized iPad and applied them to the design of this 2.38-pound computer.To say that the Air is svelte is all at once stating the obvious and understating the truth. The system is defined by its unibody aluminum enclosure. At its thickest point the computer is only 0.68"" -- it tapers down to 0.11"" at its thinnest.The system is loaded with 128GB of flash storage rather than an old-fashioned hard drive. Flash storage doesn't just give you a lighter, thinner computer. It also allows for impressive battery life -- up to 9 hours of web browsing and 30 days of standby time.The MacBook Air is housed in an aluminum unibody enclosure, which is as strong as it is light. Because it is cut from a solid block of aluminum, the housing is stronger than those found on laptops built via traditional means.At 11.6"" in size, the 16:9 display features a native resolution of 1366 x 768. It features a glossy finish and LED backlight technology for enhanced image quality and energy efficiency.Computers in the MacBook Air's weight class are most often classified in the ""netbook"" category. Netbooks typically feature less-than-full-size keyboards, cramped trackpads, and low-powered CPUs. Not so with the MacBook Air. This computer features a standard-size backlit chiclet keyboard, the same as on the larger computers in the MacBook line. It also has a large multi-touch glass trackpad, giving you full control over your computer -- without sacrificing ergonomics.The computer is powered by a dual-core 5th-gen, low-voltage Broadwell 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5 processor and has 4GB of onboard 1600 MHz LPDDR3 RAM. Graphics are provided by integrated Intel HD Graphics 6000. The computer features all the amenities you expect on a Mac -- a FaceTime HD webcam, dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi (also compatible with 802.11a/b/g/n), Bluetooth 4.0 and built-in stereo speakers.This MacBook Air comes preloaded with the user-friendly Mac OS X operating system. The Mac OS X features Time Machine backup, which automatically backs up system data to an external hard drive. It also features natural scrolling, the Launchpad application launcher and support for full screen applications. Mission Control combines the functionality of Dashboard, Exposé, and Spaces -- giving you a bird's eye view of everything that is happening on your computer.The Auto Save feature on the MacBook Air ensures that you won't lose data, even when you forget to save a file. The OS tracks different versions of your documents, so you can go back to a previous draft of a document with ease. AirDrop makes it easy to transmit files wirelessly between computers, even if there is no central Wi-Fi network available. The revamped Mail application takes full advantage of modern widescreen displays.And of course, you can expand the functionality of your computer system by browsing through the multitude of productivity applications, games, and other software that is available for purchase from the Mac App Store. Because the software in the store is curated by Apple, you can be sure that it is free of malware and safe to use. And, like the iOS App Store, you'll automatically be notified when updated versions of your favorite programs are available for download.",https://walmart.com/ip/5H5DQHAVZ8LD,Electronics,/Apple Laptops,$459.98,4.4,44 ratings

Working together with the power-efficient Intel Core architecture, this battery can post some impressive numbers. That gives you all-day power for word processing, presentations, email, and more. And if you enable Power Nap, you'll continue to receive new email and calendar invitations while your computer is asleep. Performance, meet enduranceMacBook Air is powered by the fourth-generation Intel Core i5 processors. This ultra-efficient architecture was designed to use less power and still deliver high performance. Which means not only can you do whatever you want - you can keep doing it for longer than before. In addition, the Intel HD Graphics offers up to 40 percent faster graphics - performance you'll especially notice with games and other graphics-intensive tasks. 802.11acMacBook Air now supports ultrafast 802.11ac Wi-Fi. When connected to an 802.11ac base station - including the Airport Extreme and Airport Time Capsule - wireless performance is up to 3x faster than with the previous generation of MacBook Air. And your Wi-Fi range improves as well. With Bluetooth technology, you can connect MacBook Air to Bluetooth-enabled devices like speakers and headphones. Even without all the wires, you're totally connected. Faster all-flash storagePart of what makes MacBook Air so responsive is that it's designed entirely around flash storage. Not only does this make MacBook Air much lighter and more portable than traditional notebooks, it also provides faster access to data. This next-generation flash storage is up to 9x faster than a traditional 5400-rpm notebook hard drive. And it's up to 45 percent faster than the flash storage in the previous-generation MacBook Air. So when you flip open MacBook Air, it's ready to go right away. Even after a month in standby mode, the screen springs to life. Thunderbolt and USB 3With the lightning-fast Thunderbolt port, you can connect your MacBook Air to the latest devices and displays, like the Apple Thunderbolt Display. But that's not the whole story. MacBook Air also comes equipped with two USB 3 ports, so you can connect the USB 3 devices and all your USB 2 devices as well. With just a few connections, MacBook Air transforms from an ultraportable notebook to a complete workstation. LED-backlit displayCorner to corner and pixel by pixel, the MacBook Air display is both an engineering feat and a design breakthrough. The display measures a mere 4.86 millimeters (0.19 inch) thin, yet its resolution makes you feel like you're looking at a larger screen. And LED backlighting makes colors bright and vibrant from edge to edge. So whether you're editing photos, perfecting a presentation, or watching a movie, you're going to love what you see. 720p FaceTime HD cameraLet your friends and family see more of you with the 720p FaceTime HD camera. Every smile looks bright, even halfway around the world. And the widescreen format means everyone can fit into the picture without having to crowd around the display. Dual micsThe dual microphones in MacBook Air are great for when you want to be heard. If you're making a FaceTime call, for example, the mics reduce background noise from behind the notebook. And when you use Dictation, they create an adaptive audio beam that intelligently adjusts to detect your voice - instead of the noise around you. Multi-Touch trackpad.The Multi-Touch gestures in OS X make everything you do on MacBook Air more intuitive, direct, and fun. And the spacious Multi-Touch trackpad is perfectly designed for them, whether it's a three-finger swipe to activate Mission Control or a four-finger pinch to see all your apps in Launchpad. Gesture responses are smooth and realistic. So when you're scrolling up and down a web page or swiping from one full-screen app to another, it's almost like you're touching what you're seeing.

1896DQZVBCWO,"Apple MacBook Air 13.3"" MMGF2LL/A Silver - Intel Core i5 1.6GHz - 8GB RAM - 128GB SSD - (Refurbished)"," The13.3"" MacBook Air Laptop Computer (Early 2015)fromAppleis an ultraportable notebook computer with a thin and lightweight design. Apple's engineers have leveraged the lessons they learned in designing the miniaturized iPad and applied them to the design of this 2.96-pound computer. To say that the Air is svelte is all at once stating the obvious and understating the truth. The system is defined by its unibody aluminum enclosure. At its thickest point the computer is only 0.68"" -- it tapers down to 0.11"" at its thinnest. The system is loaded with 128GB of flash storage rather than an old-fashioned hard drive. Flash storage doesn't just give you a lighter, thinner computer. It also allows for impressive battery life -- up to 12 hours of web browsing and 30 days of standby time. The MacBook Air is housed in an aluminum unibody enclosure, which is as strong as it is light. Because it is cut from a solid block of aluminum, the housing is stronger than those found on laptops built via traditional means. At 13.3"" in size, the 16:10 display features a native resolution of 1440 x 900. It features a glossy finish and LED backlight technology for enhanced image quality and energy efficiency. Computers in the MacBook Air's weight class are most often classified in the ""netbook"" category. Netbooks typically feature less-than-full-size keyboards, cramped trackpads, and low-powered CPUs. Not so with the MacBook Air. This computer features a standard-size backlit chiclet keyboard, the same as on the larger computers in the MacBook line. It also has a large multi-touch glass trackpad, giving you full control over your computer -- without sacrificing ergonomics. The computer is powered by a dual-core 5th-gen, low-voltage Broadwell 1.6 GHz Intel Core i5 processor and has 8GB of 1600 MHz LPDDR3 RAM. Graphics are provided by integrated Intel HD Graphics 5000. The computer features all the amenities you expect on a Mac -- a FaceTime HD webcam, dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi (also compatible with 802.11a/b/g/n), Bluetooth 4.0 and built-in stereo speakers. The MacBook Air comes with a complete suite of digital creativity applications. iMovie will help you edit your home movies, iPhoto will organize digital photos, and GarageBand allows you to compose original music. The Macbook Air also provides three apps to keep you productive. Pages allow you to make creative word documents. Numbers helps you make spreadsheets more visually insightful. Keynote allows you to create a powerful presentation, complete with animated charts, interactive tables with cinematic effects and transitions. This MacBook Air comes preloaded with the user-friendly Mac OS X operating system. The Mac OS X features Time Machine backup, which automatically backs up system data to an external hard drive. It also features natural scrolling, the Launchpad application launcher and support for full screen applications. Mission Control combines the functionality of Dashboard, Exposé, and Spaces -- giving you a bird's eye view of everything that is happening on your computer. The Auto Save feature on the MacBook Air ensures that you won't lose data, even when you forget to save a file. The OS tracks different versions of your documents, so you can go back to a previous draft of a document with ease.Apple MacBook Air 13.3"" MMGF2LL/A Silver - Intel Core i5 1.6GHz - 8GB RAM - 128GB SSD - (Refurbished)",https://walmart.com/ip/1896DQZVBCWO,Electronics,/Apple,$548.93,3.3,13 ratings
