NATIONAL BESTSELLER and WINNER OF THE WOMEN'S PRIZE FOR FICTION England, 1580: The Black Death creeps across the land, an ever-present threat, infecting the healthy, the sick, the old and the young, alike. The end of days is near, but life always goes on.  A young Latin tutor--penniless and bullied by a violent father--falls in love with an extraordinary, eccentric young woman. Agnes is a wild creature who walks her family's land with a falcon on her glove and is known throughout the countryside for her unusual gifts as a healer, understanding plants and potions better than she does people. Once she settles with her husband on Henley Street in Stratford-upon-Avon she becomes a fiercely protective mother and a steadfast, centrifugal force in the life of her young husband, whose career on the London stage is taking off when his beloved young son succumbs to sudden fever.  A luminous portrait of a marriage, a shattering evocation of a family ravaged by grief and loss, and a tender and unforgettable re-imagining of a boy whose life has been all but forgotten, and whose name was given to one of the most celebrated plays of all time, Hamnet is mesmerizing, seductive, impossible to put down--a magnificent leap forward from one of our most gifted novelists.• Author: Maggie O'Farrell • ISBN:9780525657606 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-07-21",https://walmart.com/ip/4E76A5RSJZXD,Books,/Historical Fiction Novels,$25.60,0.0,0 ratings,"['6PXQTKL7Y6LI', '4TKE8B2FW39V', '250VBGQ1YFMY', '3ECNR0N5IPQT', '75UA445P7ZS0', '1H5XZ7YGO4Y2', '56R4JO71KK12', '4DII94ZIY485', '4PZOKR6KLJX2', '3F9SA62O3H3T', '3F9SA62O3H3T', '2WZ8X7DC27UQ', '4PZOKR6KLJX2', '1ZV1TFD6FTDE', '2RHXB0M0KRH6']"

In Liane Moriarty's latest page-turner, nine perfect strangers are about to find out... Nine people gather at a remote health resort. Some are here to lose weight, some are here to get a reboot on life, some are here for reasons they can't even admit to themselves. Amidst all of the luxury and pampering, the mindfulness and meditation, they know these ten days might involve some real work. But none of them could imagine just how challenging the next ten days are going to be.  Frances Welty, the formerly best-selling romantic novelist, arrives at Tranquillum House nursing a bad back, a broken heart, and an exquisitely painful paper cut. She's immediately intrigued by her fellow guests. Most of them don't look to be in need of a health resort at all. But the person that intrigues her most is the strange and charismatic owner/director of Tranquillum House. Could this person really have the answers Frances didn't even know she was seeking? Should Frances put aside her doubts and immerse herself in everything Tranquillum House has to offer - or should she run while she still can?  It's not long before every guest at Tranquillum House is asking exactly the same question.  Combining all of the hallmarks that have made her writing a go-to for anyone looking for wickedly smart, page-turning fiction that will make you laugh and gasp, Liane Moriarty's  Nine Perfect Strangers once again shows why she is a master of her craft. • Author: Liane Moriarty • ISBN:9781250755834 • Format:Paperback • Publication Date:2020-09-29",https://walmart.com/ip/59F4WU7JAPZ4,Books,/Contemporary Women Novels,$7.48,4.0,1 ratings,"['6C3JOMHLIBC6', '3BJEDXSS9KW2', '4EAEZCCF59QO', '2XHK2KFZANS4', '1NCS2ETJN4NL', '7HDUIATM9D7R', '12EL6D5PRAQM', '1EP5Y8CTH4NW', '29OXLM36T0NW', '5GMCTEQUWGJ8', '5GMCTEQUWGJ8', '3WS0U5VBQC9W', '1TWIILU94ZEV', '0YJWNSJ3SNQN', '3JEH71A11DX4']"

Estranged from his family and living alone with only his cat, Cabbage, to keep him company, he was unprepared for the doctor's diagnosis that he has only months to live. But before he can tackle his bucket list, the devil shows up to make him an offer: In exchange for making one thing in the world disappear, the postman will be granted one extra day of life. And so begins a very strange week that brings the young postman and his beloved cat to the brink of existence.  With each object that disappears, the postman reflects on the life he's lived, his joys and regrets, and the people he's loved and lost.  This timeless tale from Genki Kawamura (producer of the Japanese blockbuster animated movie  Your Name) is a moving story of loss and reconciliation, and of one man's journey to discover what really matters most in life. • Author: Genki Kawamura • ISBN:9781250294050 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2019-03-12",https://walmart.com/ip/65JWF6SQTTOO,Books,/Literary Novels,$5.49,4.3,4 ratings,"['49CYFFHGWABN', '56UO835WA24I', '0Y6SPEE2KP7T', '3XKGC0SP8E9F', '6QMJPQD4IN5U', '10UUJ7OQ4VX5', '1Z8UQQ8ELIA9', '5W63N7L4UR7Q', '341N960TYZAJ', '19LCVAWBZLEU', '6D1UULHOZ614', '2A9309BUUXBJ', '22HCI7D1K1YA', '216C0ABV5EBE', '2UAAW7SZGT0M']"

GET OUT OF JAIL FREE--OR DIE  Doing time in Texas is no picnic. But getting sent to The Walls in Huntsville is a fate worse than hanging. If the guards don't kill you, the prisoners will. And if it weren't for the fact that the man who framed Hank Fallon and murdered his family could be inside The Walls, Hank would never step one foot in that heinous helltrap--let alone go undercover as an inmate. But this isn't just another assignment. This is his chance for revenge . . .   Inside The Walls, Hank quickly discovers who's boss--as well as judge, jury, and executioner. The only relief from the gang fights and guard beatings is a prison work program that allows inmates to leave The Walls to work for plantation owner J.J. Justice. Hank figures it can't be any worse than jail. But it is. Seems that Justice is ordering the men to commit robberies and murders. He's stockpiling weapons. Building an army.

Getting snowed in at a luxurious, rustic ski chalet high in the French Alps doesn't sound like the worst problem in the world. Especially when there's a breathtaking vista, a full-service chef and housekeeper, a cozy fire to keep you warm, and others to keep you company. Unless that company happens to be eight coworkers...each with something to gain, something to lose, and something to hide.  When the cofounder of Snoop, a trendy London-based tech startup, organizes a weeklong trip for the team in the French Alps, it starts out as a corporate retreat like any other: PowerPoint presentations and strategy sessions broken up by mandatory bonding on the slopes. But as soon as one shareholder upends the agenda by pushing a lucrative but contentious buyout offer, tensions simmer and loyalties are tested. The storm brewing inside the chalet is no match for the one outside, however, and a devastating avalanche leaves the group cut off from all access to the outside world. Even worse, one Snooper hadn't made it back from the slopes when the avalanche hit.  As each hour passes without any sign of rescue, panic mounts, the chalet grows colder, and the group dwindles further...one by one.• Author: Ruth Ware • ISBN:9781501188817 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-09-08",https://walmart.com/ip/1H5XZ7YGO4Y2,Books,/Literary Novels,$16.79,5.0,1 ratings,"['49CYFFHGWABN', '56UO835WA24I', '0Y6SPEE2KP7T', '3XKGC0SP8E9F', '6QMJPQD4IN5U', '5TDCGVYFBYZP', '3F9SA62O3H3T', '56R4JO71KK12', '26VWTTA4KZL4', '341FJC5KVFZQ', '341FJC5KVFZQ', '26VWTTA4KZL4', '56R4JO71KK12', '4DII94ZIY485', '3LXAH568VH6C']"

2BVQM3KGELLZ,Child's Play (Paperback),"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - The lessons our children teach us are the hardest ones. What do we do when our children don't pursue our hopes for them? In this riveting new novel, Danielle Steel explores how families can evolve and grow in unexpected ways.   A senior partner at a prestigious New York law firm, Kate Morgan couldn't be prouder of her three grown children. Tamara, Anthony, and Claire all went to great schools, chose wonderful career paths, and would have made their father proud. A single mother for years after the death of her husband, Kate keeps a tight rein on her family, her career, and even her own emotions, never once asking herself if she truly knows her children or if her hopes for them are the right ones, and what they want. She is about to find out.   During one hectic summer in Manhattan, Kate's world turns upside down. One child has been keeping an astonishing secret while another confesses to an equally shocking truth. A wonderful match and picture-book wedding are traded for a relationship that shakes Kate to her core. A totally inappropriate love affair and an out-of-wedlock baby complete the chaos. Challenged as a mother and as a successful independent woman herself, Kate struggles to keep up with a dizzying and escalating chain of events, and begins to realize that she has a part to play in the chaos. Because Kate too has kept secrets from her children.   Sometimes the surprising choices our children make are the right ones better than what we wanted for them. More often than not, parenting is about letting go of our dreams and embracing theirs.Child's Play (Paperback)",https://walmart.com/ip/2BVQM3KGELLZ,Books,/Contemporary Romance Books,$6.74,5.0,3 ratings,"['4CM7HTZMB6MA', '516QGJQ74E0N', '28VK59K6TGKW', '5O0DR3CVVC0Y', '0SXSFRYHACIU', '2YJV5NNFK7V3', '75CU8FUCX6EE', '29OXLM36T0NW', '1EP5Y8CTH4NW', '79P3778TP3YF', '5GMCTEQUWGJ8', '12EL6D5PRAQM', '0YJWNSJ3SNQN', '5KKDO7WPP7C5', '2OI5VI35DA4X']"

Everything changes in a single moment for Dawn Edelstein. She's on a plane when the flight attendant makes an announcement: Prepare for a crash landing. She braces herself as thoughts flash through her mind. The shocking thing is, the thoughts are not of her husband but of a man she last saw fifteen years ago: Wyatt Armstrong.    Dawn, miraculously, survives the crash, but so do all the doubts that have suddenly been raised. She has led a good life. Back in Boston, there is her husband, Brian, their beloved daughter, and her work as a death doula, in which she helps ease the transition between life and death for her clients.    But somewhere in Egypt is Wyatt Armstrong, who works as an archaeologist unearthing ancient burial sites, a career Dawn once studied for but was forced to abandon when life suddenly intervened. And now, when it seems that fate is offering her second chances, she is not as sure of the choice she once made.    After the crash landing, the airline ensures that the survivors are seen by a doctor, then offers transportation to wherever they want to go. The obvious destination is to fly home, but she could take another path: return to the archaeological site she left years before, reconnect with Wyatt and their unresolved history, and maybe even complete her research on The Book of Two Ways--the first known map of the afterlife.    As the story unfolds, Dawn's two possible futures unspool side by side, as do the secrets and doubts long buried with them. Dawn must confront the questions she's never truly asked: What does a life well lived look like? When we leave this earth, what do we leave behind? Do we make choices . . . or do our choices make us?

""A lyrical work of self-discovery that's shockingly intimate and insistently universal...Not so much briefly gorgeous as permanently stunning."" --Ron Charles, The Washington Post Poet Ocean Vuong's debut novel is a shattering portrait of a family, a first love, and the redemptive power of storytelling   On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous is a letter from a son to a mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family's history that began before he was born -- a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam -- and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness,  On Earth We're Briefly Gorgeous is as much about the power of telling one's own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard.  With stunning urgency and grace, Ocean Vuong writes of people caught between disparate worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without forsaking who we are. The question of how to survive, and how to make of it a kind of joy, powers the most important debut novel of many years.

Club, Nylon, The Week, The Rumpus, The Millions, The Guardian, Publishers Weekly, and more.“A lyrical work of self-discovery that’s shockingly intimate and insistently universal…Not so much briefly gorgeous as permanently stunning.” —Ron Charles, The Washington PostPoet Ocean Vuong’s debut novel is a shattering portrait of a family, a first love, and the redemptive power of storytelling   On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous is a letter from a son to a mother who cannot read. Written when the speaker, Little Dog, is in his late twenties, the letter unearths a family’s history that began before he was born — a history whose epicenter is rooted in Vietnam — and serves as a doorway into parts of his life his mother has never known, all of it leading to an unforgettable revelation. At once a witness to the fraught yet undeniable love between a single mother and her son, it is also a brutally honest exploration of race, class, and masculinity. Asking questions central to our American moment, immersed as we are in addiction, violence, and trauma, but undergirded by compassion and tenderness,  On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous is as much about the power of telling one’s own story as it is about the obliterating silence of not being heard.   With stunning urgency and grace, Ocean Vuong writes of people caught between disparate worlds, and asks how we heal and rescue one another without forsaking who we are. The question of how to survive, and how to make of it a kind of joy, powers the most important debut novel of many years.

Trevor Benson never intended to move back to New Bern, North Carolina. But when a mortar blast outside the hospital where he worked sent him home from Afghanistan with devastating injuries, the dilapidated cabin he'd inherited from his grandfather seemed as good a place to regroup as any.  Tending to his grandfather's beloved beehives, Trevor isn't prepared to fall in love with a local . . . yet, from their very first encounter, Trevor feels a connection with deputy sheriff Natalie Masterson that he can't ignore. But even as she seems to reciprocate his feelings, she remains frustratingly distant, making Trevor wonder what she's hiding.  Further complicating his stay in New Bern is the presence of a sullen teenage girl, Callie, who lives in the trailer park down the road. Trevor hopes Callie can shed light on the mysterious circumstances of his grandfather's death, but she offers few clues -- until a crisis triggers a race to uncover the true nature of Callie's past, one more intertwined with the elderly man's passing than Trevor could ever have imagined.  In his quest to unravel Natalie and Callie's secrets, Trevor will learn the true meaning of love and forgiveness . . . and that in life, to move forward, we must often return to the place where it all began.

Kaylee Sloan's home in Southern California is full of wonderful memories of the woman who raised her. But the memories are prolonging her grief over her mother's recent death.

Determined to escape distractions and avoid the holiday season, Kaylee borrows a cabin in Virgin River.

Until she arrives at a building that has just gone up in flames. Devastated, she heads to Jack's Bar to plan her next steps.

And then there's the dog trainer who knows exactly how to help  her. As the holidays approach, Kaylee's dread turns to wonder.

75ZQ69GLINZB,Friends Forever : A Novel,"Forging inseparable bonds in childhood that reinforce them throughout their teen years, two girls and three boys go their separate ways as adults and encounter respective tragedies and transformations.NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER  Five children meet on the first day of kindergarten. In the years that follow, they become friends and more than friends. Together, they will find strength, meet challenges, face life’s adventures, endure loss, face stark realities, and open their hearts. In this moving novel, #1  New York Times bestselling author Danielle Steel traces their unforgettable journey—full of tests and trials—as three boys and two girls discover the vital bonds that will last a lifetime.     FRIENDS FOREVER     Gabby, Billy, Izzie, Andy, and Sean—each bursting with their own personality, strikingly different looks and talents, in sports, science, and the arts. Each drawn by the magical spark of connection that happens to the young. At the exclusive Atwood School, on a bright September day, starting in kindergarten they become an inseparable group known to outsiders as the Big Five. In this rarefied world, five families grow closer, and five children bloom beside one another, unaware of the storms gathering around them.     As they turn from grade-schoolers to teenagers, seemingly perfect lives are buffeted by unraveling families, unfortunate missteps, and losses and victories great and small. And, one by one, they turn back to the Big Five to regain their footing and their steady course. But as they emerge from Atwood and enter the college years, the way forward is neither safe nor clear. As their lives separate and diverge, the challenges and risks become greater, the losses sharper, and the right paths harder to choose, in a journey of friendship, survival, and love.     In what may be her most intricate and emotionally powerful novel yet, Danielle Steel tells a heart-wrenching, ultimately triumphant story that spans decades, weaves together a vivid cast of characters, and captures the challenges we face in life—sometimes, if we’re lucky, with a friend forever by our side.",https://walmart.com/ip/75ZQ69GLINZB,Books,/Contemporary Women Novels,$4.50,3.7,6 ratings,"['51THJJFALJHX', '3ZXQ7OC83P8G', '1EE7U3XRYXRL', '2XHD1OTG2RBR', '4CUZKTPOKBT4', '3B6MFZ5283FN', '2S1GL4B6NBC7', '3TJDHHQSWWQF', '1U104CGKNH7D', '63X22QPH7S2U', '6C3JOMHLIBC6', '3BJEDXSS9KW2', '4EAEZCCF59QO', '2XHK2KFZANS4', '1NCS2ETJN4NL', '22HCI7D1K1YA', '341N960TYZAJ', '4U0LWK01IGU8', '19LCVAWBZLEU', '2UAAW7SZGT0M', '2UAAW7SZGT0M', '510XZ0SMRJOO', '6QMJPQD4IN5U', '3P87Q9LL3Y84', '6D1UULHOZ614']"

4BR47IHO7P9C,Lord of the Flies,"Capturing generations of readers since its publication in 1954, ""Lord of the Flies"" is a cult favorite among students and literary critics. An adventure tale in its purest form, this thrilling account of a group of British schoolboys marooned on a tropical island exposes the duality of human nature itself--the dark, eternal divide between order and chaos, intellect and instinct, structure and savagery.Before The Hunger Games there was Lord of the FliesLord of the Flies remains as provocative today as when it was first published in 1954, igniting passionate debate with its startling, brutal portrait of human nature. Though critically acclaimed, it was largely ignored upon its initial publication. Yet soon it became a cult favorite among both students and literary critics who compared it to J.D. Salinger's  The Catcher in the Rye in its influence on modern thought and literature.  William Golding's compelling story about a group of very ordinary small boys marooned on a coral island has become a modern classic. At first it seems as though it is all going to be great fun; but the fun before long becomes furious and life on the island turns into a nightmare of panic and death. As ordinary standards of behaviour collapse, the whole world the boys know collapses with them—the world of cricket and homework and adventure stories—and another world is revealed beneath, primitive and terrible.Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the apocalypse,  Lord of the Flies has established itself as a true classic.  ""Lord of the Flies is one of my favorite books. That was a big influence on me as a teenager, I still read it every couple of years."" —Suzanne Collins, author of The Hunger Games""As exciting, relevant, and thought-provoking now as it was when Golding published it in 1954.""—Stephen King",https://walmart.com/ip/4BR47IHO7P9C,Books,/Classic Novels,$13.74,3.7,244 ratings,"['0Y443DFOGJ0X', '35620RRYJMB6', '4PS0B65HJ3IO', '1LOJYPXQZ25Q', '5Z1RHYHK8PIB', '6EYB9CM99NVQ', '0WVOU5DY1JWV', '4KIIVTQO1JME', '40TXW5KHV212', '48S55JGF0Z94', '5MJ36ABD2Z8P', '4AXF0942Q6XU', '4WSDGUKTAQNC', '33B7B8RH0S2H', '38RXSR5ZGW79', '7FUYL7I9AWE9', '1WFKM8BVLMHK', '66KHE4DA4D1E', '5APFD62ET102', '1EJFQVOCR5LT', '3BKWXDFD8HZL', '1EJFQVOCR5LT', '0TXT1FG1EO71', '16K7T7XMOVLT', '2L07L2AN027S', '7FOAIR1IJPVT', '7931DAWPZ23P', '5UONAXLVIYBK', '1LH5C2SYZH99', '4JL9QTUNCMFP']"

1P0VCLWK7LSY,Outfox,"From the #1 NYT bestselling author: After a thirty-year search for a serial killer, FBI agent Drex Easton becomes a suspect's next-door neighbor but can he navigate a shocking series of twists and turns to track down the truth?FBI agent Drex Easton is relentlessly driven by a single goal: to outmaneuver the conman once known as Weston Graham. Over the past thirty years, Weston has assumed many names and countless disguises, enabling him to lure eight wealthy women out of their fortunes before they disappeared without a trace, their families left without answers and the authorities without clues. The only common trait among the victims: a new man in their life who also vanished, leaving behind no evidence of his existence . . . except for one signature custom.Drex is convinced that these women have been murdered, and that the man he knows as Weston Graham is the sociopath responsible. But each time Drex gets close to catching him, Weston trades one persona for another and disappears again. Now, for the first time in their long game of cat and mouse, Drex has a suspect in sight.Attractive and charming, Jasper Ford is recently married to a successful businesswoman many years his junior, Talia Shafer. Drex insinuates himself into their lives, posing as a new neighbor and setting up surveillance on their house. The closer he gets to the couple, the more convinced he becomes that Jasper is the clever, merciless predator he's sought--and that his own attraction to Talia threatens to compromise his purpose and integrity.This is Drex's one chance to outfox his cunning nemesis before he murders again and eludes justice forever. But first he must determine if the desirable Talia is a heartless accomplice . . . or the next victim.• Author: Sandra Brown • ISBN:9781455572205 • Format:Paperback • Publication Date:2020-08-04",https://walmart.com/ip/1P0VCLWK7LSY,Books,/Suspense Books,$7.48,5.0,1 ratings,"['3E9ARZHW9B8R', '3UKPDYWXLKWY', '6ZB4EMXPFSIQ', '7ICJX6KOAAY1', '6EK3YNQGXOXZ', '6QMJPQD4IN5U', '4GO2I8X3ZZYH', '5WDL55Z3040Z', '13MR2QQNH163', '454BS7BU1P45', '13MR2QQNH163', '1BHJRT58S10R', '79JO9AMZ01O1', '36F9TC3R0SPV', '6LK4K0VFNEY1']"

""Why is this town called Mother's Rest?"" That's all Reacher wants to know. But no one will tell him. It's a tiny place hidden in a thousand square miles of wheat fields, with a railroad stop, and sullen and watchful people, and a worried woman named Michelle Chang, who mistakes him for someone else: her missing partner in a private investigation she thinks must have started small and then turned lethal.   Reacher has no particular place to go, and all the time in the world to get there, and there's something about Chang . . . so he teams up with her and starts to ask around. He thinks: How bad can this thing be? But before long he's plunged into a desperate race through LA, Chicago, Phoenix, and San Francisco, and through the hidden parts of the internet, up against thugs and assassins every step of the way--right back to where he started, in Mother's Rest, where he must confront the worst nightmare he could imagine.   Walking away would have been easier. But as always, Reacher's rule is: If you want me to stop, you're going to have to make me.

But no one will tell him. It’s a tiny place hidden in a thousand square miles of wheat fields, with a railroad stop, and sullen and watchful people, and a worried woman named Michelle Chang, who mistakes him for someone else: her missing partner in a private investigation she thinks must have started small and then turned lethal.   Reacher has no particular place to go, and all the time in the world to get there, and there’s something about Chang . . . so he teams up with her and starts to ask around. He thinks: How bad can this thing be? But before long he’s plunged into a desperate race through LA, Chicago, Phoenix, and San Francisco, and through the hidden parts of the internet, up against thugs and assassins every step of the way—right back to where he started, in Mother’s Rest, where he must confront the worst nightmare he could imagine.   Walking away would have been easier. But as always, Reacher’s rule is: If you want me to stop, you’re going to have to make me.   Praise for Make Me   “Child’s Reacher series has hit Book No. 20 with a resounding peal of wisecracking glee. Everything about it, starting with Reacher’s nose for bad news, is as strong as ever. . . . The big guy’s definitely on the upswing. The guy who writes about him is too.” —Janet Maslin, The New York Times  “Another winner . . .

And he needed to stay that way. For Hannah.  Berlin, 1941. Felix Thalberg, a printer's apprentice, has the weight of the world on his shoulders. His beloved city is changing under Nazi rule and at home things are no better - Felix's father hasn't left the house since he was forced to wear a yellow star, and his mother grows thinner every day.

But when he tries to find her again, she's vanished without a trace.  Was Hannah taken away by the Gestapo and held prisoner... or worse? When Felix himself is imprisoned in Sachsenhausen concentration camp, his thoughts are only for her safety. And when a life-threatening injury lands him on the ward of Dr Max Eichel - a Nazi medical officer with a sadistic reputation - his love for his lost Hannah sees him through the pain.  Until one day Dr Eichel brings his pretty young wife to tour the camp and Felix's world is thrown off-kilter. Framed in the hospital window he sees - impossibly - the same girl he met that fateful night... her wrist in the vice-like grip of the deathly calm SS Officer.

1HSM9XEBDE2I,Santa Monica (Paperback),"A debut novel in the vein of Liane Moriarty and Tom Perrotta, about dark secrets brought to life after the mysterious death of a handsome and charismatic trainer to the elite women in Santa Monica. On the western edge of Los Angeles is the gorgeous beachside city of Santa Monica, where the sun-kissed, wealthy residents seem to inhabit real-life California dreams. When movie-star-handsome heartthrob fitness coach Zack Doheny, is found dead on the floor of his gym, the tragedy shocks the elite community, especially those who'd spent many hours each week exercising with the charismatic trainer.  As the narrative flashes back to the months leading up to Zack's death, it quickly becomes clear that things in this coastal paradise are not as glittering as they seem. Lettie - Zack's secret half-sister and an undocumented housekeeper for the toned, entitled women of Santa Monica - holds her brother responsible for a horrific family accident, and desperately needs his money to prevent her deportation. Regina, type-A exercise addict and entrepreneur, will do anything to get out of debt and to claim Zack for herself. And Mel - a New York City transplant who finds herself forty pounds heavier and far more cynical than the lithe women of Santa Monica - discovers an electric attraction to Zack that threatens to disrupt his bond with Regina and upend Mel's own marriage. As these residents of Santa Monica begin to crack under the stress of their secrets, one question hangs above it all: what really happened to Zack Doheny?  As addictively suspenseful as it is sharply observed, hilarious, and compassionate, Santa Monica is the rare novel that captures readers with propulsive storytelling alongside emotional urgency, irresistible characters, ambitious themes, and a vivid sense of place.• Author: Cassidy Lucas • ISBN:9780063018440 • Format:Paperback • Publication Date:2020-10-06",https://walmart.com/ip/1HSM9XEBDE2I,Books,/Suspense Books,$13.49,0.0,0 ratings,"['3E9ARZHW9B8R', '3UKPDYWXLKWY', '2QWRPC9DQK1G', '6ZB4EMXPFSIQ', '7ICJX6KOAAY1', '5GMCTEQUWGJ8', '29OXLM36T0NW', '12EL6D5PRAQM', '0YJWNSJ3SNQN', '1EP5Y8CTH4NW', '2AF5CY9N3HEP', '3WS0U5VBQC9W', '3JEH71A11DX4', '2YJV5NNFK7V3', '1TWIILU94ZEV']"

None more deadly than him.After a covert mission became personal, the only way elite counterterrorism operative, Alexander King, could keep his loved ones safe, and the eyes of Washington's enemies blind to his existence, was to disappear.A year after his family buried a body they thought was his, King saves a young woman from a car bomb in London, and that's when his work in the shadows becomes complicated. Because she's not who he thinks she is, and the web that King is pulled into is tangled with enemies that reach the highest levels of the United States government.But this web being spun by a sadistic terrorist isn't your average one-time explosive attack.

At twenty-five, Naomi has never been married, and both her mother, Barbara, and her grandmother, Ruth, have recently been widowed.

When a storm on Christmas Eve forces the three couples to take shelter in the basement of the Stotlzfus homestead, secrets are revealed, hearts are opened, and all three potential grooms drop to their knees for very different reasons--a proposal, a prayer, and an epiphany.

But the cat isn't the only Christmas visitor: a group of young people help bring the Christmas spirit to Emma, reminding her that love and hope abide.

0XS789SV9WQV,In the Sunroom with Raymond Carver (Paperback),"Dannye Powell's poems are insightful and smart, and her gift for the perfect metaphor continues to feel effortless and natural. She finds humor in some of the bumps life amply provides, so that even poems dealing with difficult moments and tough issues leave the reader feeling uplifted. -Susan Ludvigson  A new collection of poetry by Dannye Romine Powell remains cause for celebration; and her latest, In the Sunroom with Raymond Carver, underscores her abiding reputation as a poet of breathtaking candor and precision, the consummate craftswoman, who painstakingly parses syllables into words as if sifting for gold. These yearning, often prayerful, poems are laced with shimmer, incandescence--sometimes blinding--moments of recognition and epiphany that inform every chiseled line Powell commits to paper. Above all, her work is intricately exacting. She gets things right: the truth, the light, how we say things, how we don't say things, the nuanced choreography of imperceptibly monumental moments. Yet, make no mistake: the poet desists sentimentality, as she does so fiercely at every turn in this amazingly beautiful and courageous volume.

6FLYEL8NPKPS,Perfect Nightmare : A Novel,"From ""New York Times"" bestselling author Saul comes a pulse-pounding tour de force in which a woman's search for her missing daughter leads her into the twisted world of a madman's obsession. Postponed from 2/06If you open your house to strangers, who knows who might come in. And what they might be after. Or whom. Now, ponder the unthinkable and surrender to your darkest dread, as sinister storyteller extraordinaire John Saul weaves a heart-stopping tale of lurking terror and twisted intent.   Every parent’s nightmare becomes reality for Kara Marshall when her daughter, Lindsay, vanishes from her bedroom during the night. The police suspect that the girl is just another moody teenage runaway, angry over leaving behind her school and friends because her family is moving. But Lindsay’s recent eerie claim–that someone invaded her room when the house was opened to prospective buyers–drives Kara to fear the worst: a nameless, faceless stalker has walked the halls of her home in search of more than a place to live.   Patrick Shields recognizes Kara’s pain–and carries plenty of his own since he lost his wife and two children in a devastating house fire. But more than grief draws Patrick and Kara together. He, too, senses the hand of a malevolent stranger in this tragedy. And as more people go missing from houses up for sale, Patrick’s suspicion, like Kara’s, blooms into horrified certainty.    Someone is trolling this peaceful community–undetected and undeterred–harvesting victims for a purpose no sane mind can fathom. Someone Kara and Patrick, alone and desperate, are determined to unmask. Someone who is even now watching, plotting, keeping a demented diary of unspeakable deeds . . . and waiting until the time is ripe for another fateful visit.",https://walmart.com/ip/6FLYEL8NPKPS,Books,/Horror Novels,$8.54,3.4,11 ratings,"['2KW75HX9J9PG', '2CS97NGWRWCK', '57B97UQK5Z04', '7CAUVO2JC0YU', '5W5L3Q72V53O', '4OB6V68VOCWK', '442UN641G0V4', '45Y1N294BM2A', '0X4TV275L0YV', '62LC8PL5YSH0', '0ZB6Z9W2346H', '4H4IHOPL2ZNT', '2EA9F9MRKWLC', '250X43SWDHU8', '69IOSWGA04GW', '6JHVLLX7MC2U', '64LX77L03PWK', '3BKWXDFD8HZL', '3SR1ELG3S6NQ', '59U4PU1H07EA', '1Z8UQQ8ELIA9', '59U4PU1H07EA', '3XO0NDCQQXND', '2YW0P91CNIWX', '3ZLHAGVUQ9RT', '1FCVASC9D4W8', '5PL2YB5ZDVAB', '3KHDVEK12Y92', '6UBNCFC9L888', '64VYMCX68KF9']"

She’s got direction, ambition, and a mother who’s intent on keeping her that way.  But she’s barely moved into her freshman dorm when she runs into Hardin.

He'll call her beautiful, then insist he isn’t the one for her and disappear again and again.

What lies ahead? Discover what no book has ever revealed . . . until now!   Are the unprecedented crises of our times, the signs and warnings of coming judgment?   Does an ancient mystery hold the secret to the events of our times, and the future of America and the world?   Is this mystery even behind the shakings that have now overtaken the world and America?   How much time do we have left?   In 2012, Jonathan Cahn caused a worldwide sensation with the release of his first book and massive bestseller  The Harbinger. It was hailed as 'stunning, ' 'prophetic' 'mind-blowing, ' and 'astonishing.' Cahn followed it with bestseller after bestseller but he has always held off on writing a sequel. But now, for the first time, Cahn opens up what could not be unlocked before - the mysteries that couldn't be revealed until the present time, the manifestations that have taken place since  The Harbinger came out and up to the present hour, and the mysteries of what is yet to come.   Ever since The Harbinger was released, people have been asking ...   Is an ancient mystery determining America's future? Have the harbingers of judgment continued to manifest on American soil?  Is America closer now than ever before to judgment and what lies ahead for America and the world?  The Harbinger ended by speaking of what was yet to come. That which was written is now coming true. After years of holding back, because he believed it wasn't yet the time, Jonathan Cahn has now written the sequel.  The Harbinger II is being hailed as ""a prophetic masterpiece"" even more powerful and stunning than the first book and will take the mystery to new dimensions and disclose what could not be revealed in  The Harbinger or until now.  The Harbinger II will open up the mysteries of the Gate, the Watchmen, the Mystery Ship, the Word in the Ruins, the Book of Days, the Image, the Judgment Tree, the Children of the Ruins, the Convergence, the Handwriting on the Wall, and much more. It will ultimately reveal the mystery of what is yet to come, including the Shakings, the Plague, the Western Terrace, the Island, the Day of the Watchman, and more.   As in the first book, the mysteries and revelations of  The Harbinger II are completely real and are determining the course of world events to this day. And the mysteries are, likewise, revealed through a narrative. In  The Harbinger II, the reader will witness the return of Nouriel, Ana Goren, and the mysterious figure known as  'the prophet.' The prophet will now continue the revelation  from where  it left off and open up mysteries as stunning and mind-blowing as the first. As in the prophet's first appearance, the revelations will be unlocked, one by one, through the giving of ancient seals, but also through dreams, and a little girl as mysterious as the prophet. In  The Harbinger II the reader will be taken on a mysterious and epic journey to uncover the new revelations: from an island in the waters of New England, to the steps of the Supreme Court, to the top of the tower at Ground Zero, to a primeval forest, to the House of Faces, to the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty.  The Harbinger II will also reveal the answer and the keys we each need to have for the days that lie ahead.   After reading  The Harbinger II, you will never see the world the same way again.

7050QOXAY02T,El traidor. El diario secreto del hijo del Mayo / The Traitor. The secret diary of Mayo's son,"El traidor es uno de los trabajos periodísticos más ambiciosos en la trayectoria de Anabel Hernández. Su historia se remonta a enero de 2011, cuando la contactó uno de los abogados de Vicente Zambada Niebla, mejor conocido como Vicentillo, quien enfrentaba un juicio en una corte de Chicago. La intención era compartir con la periodista documentos y hechos que ampliaban y esclarecían varios de los episodios que acababa de dar a conocer en  Los señores del narco.  Entre los documentos a los que tuvo acceso se encuentran el inquietante autorretrato como payaso que aparece en la portada y los diarios realizados por Vicentillo durante las negociaciones para colaborar con el gobierno norteamericano, los cuales hasta ahora eran secretos. En ellos el capo reconstruyó su historia y la historia de una de las organizaciones de tráfico de estupefacientes más grandes del planeta.  A lo largo de estas páginas, la autora se adentra en el Cártel de Sinaloa a través del relato de Vicentillo, quien exhibe de manera descarnada cómo funciona el sistema interno que da vida a la organización criminal, la violencia, las mil formas de traficar droga y la complicidad entre políticos, empresarios y fuerzas del orden.  Pero sobre todo devela el perfil de quien durante el último medio siglo ha sido el rey del narcotráfico. Quien nunca ha pisado la cárcel y quien desde su trono ha visto caer a amigos, enemigos, socios, competidores, familiares, empleados del gobierno y hasta sus propios hijos, sin que eso haga mella en su poder, el padre de Vicentillo: Ismael el Mayo Zambada.   ENGLISH DESCRIPTION  The Traitor is one of the most ambitious journalistic works of Anabel Hernández's career. Her story dates back to January of 2011, when she's contacted by one of Vicente Zambada Niebla's lawyers, better known as Vicentillo, who was facing charges in a court in Chicago. The intention was to share with the reporter documents and facts that would broaden and clear up various episodes that had just come to light in  Los señores del narco. Among the documents to which she had access is the disturbing self-portrait as a clown that appears on the cover and the diaries kept by Vicentillo during his negotiations to collaborate with the North American government, which until now were secret. In them, el capo reconstructed his story and the story of the one of the largest drug-trafficking organizations on the planet.  In these pages, the author goes inside the Sinaloa Cartel through Vicentillo's account, who grimly exhibits the internal workings that give life to the criminal organization, the violence, the thousands of way to traffic drugs, and the complicity among politicians, businessmen, and security forces. But, above all, he unveils the profile of the person who, during the last half century, has been the king of drug trafficking.  Someone who has never stepped inside a prison cell, who from his thrown has seen his friends, enemies, partners, competitors, family members, government employees, and even his own children fall, without this ever making a dent in his power, the father of Vicentillo: Ismael el Mayo Zambada.

133ONI6CHQR3,Fifty Words for Rain (Hardcover),"""Kyoto, Japan, 1948. 'If a woman knows nothing else, she should know how to be silent ... Do not question. Do not fight. Do not resist.' Such is eight-year-old Noriko 'Nori' Kamiza's first lesson. She will not question why her mother abandoned her with only these final words. She will not fight her confinement to the attic of her grandparents' imperial estate. And she will not resist the scalding chemical baths she receives daily to lighten her shameful skin. The illegitimate child of a Japanese aristocrat and her African American GI lover, Nori is an outsider from birth. Though her grandparents take her in, they do so only to conceal her, fearful of a stain on the royal pedigree that they are desperate to uphold in a changing Japan. Obedient to a fault, Nori accepts her solitary life for what it is, despite her natural intellect and nagging curiosity about what lies outside the attic's walls. But when chance brings her legitimate older half-brother, Akira, to the estate that is his inheritance and destiny, Nori finds in him the first person who will allow her to question, and the siblings form an unlikely but powerful bond--a bond their formidable grandparents cannot allow and that will irrevocably change the lives they were always meant to lead. Because now that Nori has glimpsed a world in which perhaps there is a place for her after all, she is ready to fight to be a part of it--a battle that just might cost her everything""--• Author: Asha Lemmie • ISBN:9781524746360 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-09-01",https://walmart.com/ip/133ONI6CHQR3,Books,/Coming of Age Novels,$19.55,0.0,0 ratings,"['1S9OORXWU1O0', '4L5JCWGPKP79', '6Y4ZQKBLTLCN', '3AYLI37ZBFLJ', '3OD0BLJUQ4HH', '1H5XZ7YGO4Y2', '56R4JO71KK12', '4DII94ZIY485', '3F9SA62O3H3T', '2RHXB0M0KRH6', '3F9SA62O3H3T', '1ROGUMH8RCR5', '2RHXB0M0KRH6', '1ZV1TFD6FTDE', '2WZ8X7DC27UQ']"

Pediatrician Kent Abner received the package on a beautiful April morning. Inside was a cheap trinket, a golden egg that could be opened into two halves. When he pried it apart, highly toxic airborne fumes entered his body--and killed him.  After Eve Dallas calls the hazmat team--and undergoes testing to reassure both her and her husband that she hasn't been exposed--it's time to look into Dr. Abner's past and relationships. Not every victim Eve encounters is an angel, but it seems that Abner came pretty close--though he did ruffle some feathers over the years by taking stands for the weak and defenseless. While the lab tries to identify the deadly toxin, Eve hunts for the sender. But when someone else dies in the same grisly manner, it becomes clear that she's dealing with either a madman--or someone who has a hidden and elusive connection to both victims.• Author: J D Robb • ISBN:9781250207227 • Format:Paperback • Publication Date:2020-07-28",https://walmart.com/ip/3ZJJ4MXR2OTT,Books,/Police Procedural Books,$7.69,5.0,2 ratings,"['5F2YHKW83NBS', '1K7OF6HLAL4O', '10WD2T1C3QWV', '0W7KTV4INEM0', '2JNSYQJSYUGM', '18BDVQRWOJGI', '0VK9WJ0FAO5M', '4CKXQ8ZODV1Z', '43BEVZKX8PG4', '4CK7OKEZD9RN', '79JO9AMZ01O1', '6YNLWO1GIRJB', '70HLT9FJ6Y85', '2APPHNGO7GRU', '6MF6BD26BUYS', '6MF6BD26BUYS', '1C6VG1XHODIE', '1YEHMYUI30X9', '66QOXDP4A1PD', '13MR2QQNH163']"

1RET0A6BOIXK,The Bigot (Paperback),"Max Klein is a working-class educator. Overflowing with liberalness and bolstered by a handful of expensive degrees, he heads to the developing world to teach and make positive change in his students' lives. However, when his own life becomes entangled in a net of hostility and corruption, he's reminded that doing what's right can be difficult. Max's ensuing cynicism and downslide intersect with his brother's escalating success. A blue-collar worker, Donald Trump supporter, and outright bigot, Karl Klein gloats over his financial victories and taunts Max for being an excessively tolerant and cerebral failure. Naturally for Max, the principled intellectual, deflecting jabs from Karl, the racist ignoramus, is a cinch. But as his employment prospects worsen, whether he can maintain the moral high road becomes unclear. Indeed, while lecturing at an institute on the edge of nowhere, the teacher gets schooled by the unlikeliest of students. The Bigot: or How I Learned to Love Donald Trump offers a literary glimpse into populism and Trumpism.

The most driven--and cynical--of the Sweet Magnolias, Helen is forty-two, single and suddenly ready for the family she's put on the back burner for all these years. Unfortunately, having a child at her age comes with lots of complications, not the least of which is the absence of a serious relationship in her life.

3LHQB61KZK29,Royal (Hardcover),"In this spellbinding tale from Danielle Steel, a princess is sent away to safety during World War II, where she falls in love, and is lost forever. As the war rages on in the summer of 1943, causing massive destruction and widespread fear, the King and Queen choose to quietly send their youngest daughter, Princess Charlotte, to live with a trusted noble family in the country. Despite her fiery, headstrong nature, the princess's fragile health poses far too great a risk for her to remain in war-torn London. Third in line for the throne, seventeen year-old Charlotte reluctantly uses an alias upon her arrival in Yorkshire, her two guardians the only keepers of her true identity. In time, she settles comfortably into a life out of the spotlight, befriending a young evacuee and training with her cherished horse. But no one predicts that in the coming months she will fall deeply in love with her protectors' son. She longs for a normal life. Far from her parents, a tragic turn of events leaves an infant orphaned. Alone in the world, that child will be raised in the most humble circumstances by a modest stable manager and his wife. No one, not even she, knows of her lineage. But when a stack of hidden letters comes to light, a secret kept for nearly two decades finally surfaces, and a long lost princess emerges. A fascinating story of family and royalty, and an unforgettable portrait of an extraordinary young woman and the man who brings her home, Royal is an exhilarating work from America's most beloved storyteller.• Author: Danielle Steel • ISBN:9780399179655 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-08-18",https://walmart.com/ip/3LHQB61KZK29,Books,/Contemporary Romance Books,$17.39,5.0,1 ratings,"['4CM7HTZMB6MA', '516QGJQ74E0N', '28VK59K6TGKW', '5O0DR3CVVC0Y', '0SXSFRYHACIU', '1H5XZ7YGO4Y2', '56R4JO71KK12', '4DII94ZIY485', '2VYZ7DBYPVEB', '34MG50DYCGK2', '2VYZ7DBYPVEB', '34MG50DYCGK2', '79JO9AMZ01O1', '3F9SA62O3H3T', '3LXAH568VH6C']"

But undercover FBI agent Roman DeWinter knows something ugly is going on beneath the cozy surface.

THE ART OF DECEPTION  When the handsome Adam Haines shows up at Kirby Fairchild's ancestral home looking for a quiet place to paint, she's more than skeptical. Yet the attraction she feels for him builds, whether she wants it to or not. But when Adam begins to act suspiciously, Kirby must uncover his real purpose at her father's home before it's too late.

1Z8UQQ8ELIA9,Anxious People : A Novel,"From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of A Man Called Ove and ""writer of astonishing depth"" (The Washington Times) comes a poignant comedy about a crime that never took place, a would-be bank robber who disappears into thin air, and eight extremely anxious strangers who find they have more in common than they ever imagined. Viewing an apartment normally doesn't turn into a life-or-death situation, but this particular open house becomes just that when a failed bank robber bursts in and takes everyone in the apartment hostage. As the pressure mounts, the eight strangers slowly begin opening up to one another and reveal long-hidden truths.  First is Zara, a wealthy bank director who has been too busy to care about anyone else until tragedy changed her life. Now, she's obsessed with visiting open houses to see how ordinary people live--and, perhaps, to set an old wrong to right. Then there's Roger and Anna-Lena, an Ikea-addicted retired couple who are on a never-ending hunt for fixer-uppers to hide the fact that they don't know how to fix their own failing marriage. Julia and Ro are a young lesbian couple and soon-to-be parents who are nervous about their chances for a successful life together since they can't agree on anything. And there's Estelle , an eighty-year-old woman who has lived long enough to be unimpressed by a masked bank robber waving a gun in her face. And despite the story she tells them all, Estelle hasn't really come to the apartment to view it for her daughter, and her husband really isn't outside parking the car.  As police surround the premises and television channels broadcast the hostage situation live, the tension mounts and even deeper secrets are slowly revealed. Before long, the robber must decide which is the more terrifying prospect: going out to face the police, or staying in the apartment with this group of impossible people.  Rich with Fredrik Backman's ""pitch-perfect dialogue and an unparalleled understanding of human nature"" ( Shelf Awareness),  Anxious People's whimsical plot serves up unforgettable insights into the human condition and a gentle reminder to be compassionate to all the anxious people we encounter every day.From the #1 New York Times bestselling author of A Man Called Ove and “writer of astonishing depth” (The Washington Times) comes a poignant comedy about a crime that never took place, a would-be bank robber who disappears into thin air, and eight extremely anxious strangers who find they have more in common than they ever imagined.

""I read Little Fires Everywhere in a single, breathless sitting."" --Jodi Picoult ""To say I love this book is an understatement. It's a deep psychological mystery about the power of motherhood, the intensity of teenage love, and the danger of perfection. It moved me to tears."" --Reese Witherspoon ""Extraordinary . . . books like Little Fires Everywhere don't come along often."" --John Green  From the bestselling author of  Everything I Never Told You, a riveting novel that traces the intertwined fates of the picture-perfect Richardson family and the enigmatic mother and daughter who upend their lives.   In Shaker Heights, a placid, progressive suburb of Cleveland, everything is planned--from the layout of the winding roads, to the colors of the houses, to the successful lives its residents will go on to lead. And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principle is playing by the rules.   Enter Mia Warren--an enigmatic artist and single mother--who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenaged daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons. Soon Mia and Pearl become more than tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past and a disregard for the status quo that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community.  When old family friends of the Richardsons attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town--and puts Mia and Elena on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Elena is determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past. But her obsession will come at unexpected and devastating costs.   Little Fires Everywhere explores the weight of secrets, the nature of art and identity, and the ferocious pull of motherhood--and the danger of believing that following the rules can avert disaster.

271E8Q9DY5EK,The Fix,"In this ""perfect 'fix' for the thriller aficionado"" (Associated Press) and #1 New York Times bestseller, maverick FBI detective Amos Decker must forge an uneasy alliance with the Defense Intelligence Agency to prevent an international incident that could spell the end of the United States as we know it. Amos Decker witnesses a murder just outside FBI headquarters. A man shoots a woman execution-style on a crowded sidewalk, then turns the gun on himself.  Even with Decker's extraordinary powers of observation and deduction, the killing is baffling. Decker and his team can find absolutely no connection between the shooter -- a family man with a successful consulting business -- and his victim, a schoolteacher. Nor is there a hint of any possible motive for the attack.  Enter Harper Brown. An agent of the Defense Intelligence Agency, she orders Decker to back off the case. The murder is part of an open DIA investigation, one so classified that Decker and his team aren't cleared for it.  But they learn that the DIA believes solving the murder is now a matter of urgent national security. Critical information may have been leaked to a hostile government -- or worse, an international terrorist group -- and an attack may be imminent.  Decker's never been one to follow the rules, especially with the stakes so high. Forced into an uneasy alliance with Agent Brown, Decker remains laser focused on only one goal: solving the case before it's too late.

409XC4HHBQRN,Reading for Reform : The Social Work of Literature in the Progressive Era,"An unprecedented examination of class-bridging reform and U.S. literary history at the turn of the twentieth century  Reading for Reform rewrites the literary history of late nineteenth and early twentieth century America by putting social reform institutions at the center of literary and cultural analysis. Examining the vibrant, often fractious literary cultures that developed as part of the Progressive mandate to uplift the socially disadvantaged, it shows that in these years reformers saw literature as a way to combat the myriad social problems that plagued modern U.S. society. As they developed distinctly literary methods for Americanizing immigrants, uplifting and refining wage-earning women, and educating black students, their institutions gave rise to a new social purpose for literature. Class-bridging reform institutions--the urban settlement house, working girls' club, and African American college--are rarely addressed in literary history. Yet, Laura R. Fisher argues, they engendered important experiments in the form and social utility of American literature, from minor texts of Yiddish drama and little-known periodical and reform writers to the fiction of Edith Wharton and Nella Larsen. Fisher delves into reform's vast and largely unexplored institutional archives to show how dynamic sites of modern literary culture developed at the margins of social power.  Fisher reveals how reformist approaches to race, class, religion, and gender formation shaped American literature between the 1880s and the 1920s. In doing so, she tells a new story about the fate of literary practice, and the idea of literature's practical value, during the very years that modernist authors were proclaiming art's autonomy from concepts of social utility.

2A2FEAIYQW6J,Slay: Rivalry: The Red Edition (Paperback),"Edward Fasbender is a devil. He's my father's business rival, a powerful, vicious man who takes what he wants and bows to no one. I only took the meeting because I was curious. I thought he was going to offer me a job. But that's not what he's after at all. His proposal is much more intriguing, and I see an opportunity. An opportunity to turn the tables and bring down the devil. I've gotten in trouble playing these games before. I know when the risk is too great, when the stakes are too high. I know how to be cold and strong-willed and destructive. I know how to withstand dominant men with arrogant charm and rugged features. Yet I can't resist taking on Edward. And I can't resist the pull he has on me. Soon I'm not so sure which side of the battle I'm standing on--if I'm the warrior meant to slay,  Or the one who will be slain.

However, as time as gone on, more and more of the events predicted by this novel have become true and it is now required reading at major universities. In the Brave New World, the classes of people are divided into Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons. Each class is trained to believe that they are better off than either the people below them or above them. The people at the bottom of the scale are the laborers who do the actual work. To maintain this intelligence disparity, children of lower classes are made less smart through oxygen treatments and chemicals. Parenting and family is nonexistent and such concepts are considered archaic and disdained. All children are born as test tube babies. One fertilized egg will normally produce 96 identical twin children. However, experiments have been done in which as many as 16,000 identical children have been produced. Sex is no longer needed or wanted to produce children. As a result, a man can usually have sexual intercourse with any woman he wants. Just as almost everybody will shake your hand if you stick your hand out, in the Brave New World, almost every woman will have sexual intercourse with you if you ask her.",https://walmart.com/ip/65UWBKGY2A69,Books,/Dystopian Novels,$24.40,0.0,0 ratings,"['48GCZELGVS02', '1R0P4HKBHO1T', '5D4OQNWTGAJ9', '75PQQQ1WD2N5', '5PD5BWPFQ1TZ', '5GMCTEQUWGJ8', '1EP5Y8CTH4NW', '12EL6D5PRAQM', '0YJWNSJ3SNQN', '1TWIILU94ZEV', '1TWIILU94ZEV', '63775GSJAGAA', '3JEH71A11DX4', '2AF5CY9N3HEP', '4HVUJZ85JJN4']"

Just as Bruce Cable's Bay Books is preparing for the return of bestselling author Mercer Mann, Hurricane Leo veers from its predicted course and heads straight for the island. Florida's governor orders a mandatory evacuation, and most residents board up their houses and flee to the mainland, but Bruce decides to stay and ride out the storm.   The hurricane is devastating: homes and condos are leveled, hotels and storefronts ruined, streets flooded, and a dozen people lose their lives. One of the apparent victims is Nelson Kerr, a friend of Bruce's and an author of thrillers. But the nature of Nelson's injuries suggests that the storm wasn't the cause of his death: He has suffered several suspicious blows to the head.   Who would want Nelson dead? The local police are overwhelmed in the aftermath of the storm and ill equipped to handle the case. Bruce begins to wonder if the shady characters in Nelson's novels might be more real than fictional. And somewhere on Nelson's computer is the manuscript of his new novel. Could the key to the case be right there--in black and white? As Bruce starts to investigate, what he discovers between the lines is more shocking than any of Nelson's plot twists--and far more dangerous.

Handsome, charismatic, genius—his image is pure millennial-marketing gold for the White House. There's only one problem: Alex has a beef with the actual prince, Henry, across the pond. And when the tabloids get hold of a photo involving an Alex-Henry altercation, U.S./British relations take a turn for the worse. Heads of family, state, and other handlers devise a plan for damage control: staging a truce between the two rivals. What at first begins as a fake, Instragramable friendship grows deeper, and more dangerous, than either Alex or Henry could have imagined. Soon Alex finds himself hurtling into a secret romance with a surprisingly unstuffy Henry that could derail the campaign and upend two nations and begs the question: Can love save the world after all? Where do we find the courage, and the power, to be the people we are meant to be? And how can we learn to let our true colors shine through?

25JFH3OV696T,Eleanor (Hardcover),"Michaelis presents a portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt, America's longest-serving First Lady, an avatar of democracy whose ever-expanding agency as diplomat, activist, and humanitarian made her one of the world's most widely admired and influential women.  Prizewinning bestselling author David Michaelis presents a breakthrough portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt, America's longest-serving First Lady, an avatar of democracy whose ever-expanding agency as diplomat, activist, and humanitarian made her one of the world's most widely admired and influential women.  In the first single-volume cradle-to-grave portrait in six decades, acclaimed biographer David Michaelis delivers a stunning account of Eleanor Roosevelt's remarkable life of transformation. An orphaned niece of President Theodore Roosevelt, she converted her Gilded Age childhood of denial and secrecy into an irreconcilable marriage with her ambitious fifth cousin Franklin. Despite their inability to make each other happy, Franklin Roosevelt transformed Eleanor from a settlement house volunteer on New York's Lower East Side into a matching partner in New York's most important power couple in a generation.  When Eleanor discovered Franklin's betrayal with her younger, prettier social secretary, Lucy Mercer, she offered a divorce and vowed to face herself honestly. Here is an Eleanor both more vulnerable and more aggressive, more psychologically aware and sexually adaptable than we knew. She came to accept FDR's bond with his executive assistant, Missy LeHand; she allowed her children to live their own lives, as she never could; and she explored her sexual attraction to women, among them a star female reporter on FDR's first presidential campaign, and younger men.  Eleanor needed emotional connection. She pursued deeper relationships wherever she could find them. Throughout her life and travels, there was always another person or place she wanted to heal. As FDR struggled to recover from polio, Eleanor became a voice for the voiceless, her husband's proxy in presidential ambition, and then the people's proxy in the White House. Later, she would be the architect of international human rights and world citizen of the Atomic Age, urging Americans to cope with the anxiety of global annihilation by cultivating a ""world mind."" She insisted that we cannot live for ourselves alone but must learn to live together or we will die together.  Drawing on new research, Michaelis's riveting portrait is not just a comprehensive biography of a major American figure, but the story of an American ideal: how our freedom is always a choice.  Eleanor rediscovers a model of what is noble and evergreen in the American character, a model we need today more than ever.• Author: David Michaelis • ISBN:9781439192016 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-10-06",https://walmart.com/ip/25JFH3OV696T,Books,/19th Century United States History Books,$25.17,0.0,0 ratings,"['30QRM4SOQ02C', '569Q1UY3V5K4', '2KBNVAXG77A0', '5LOTI2TARY2V', '5Z1VVBIT8MO5', '2CQ3MYYBL6AR', '1UR6CB3XVXJS', '4124VDRJ5J8X', '6U0DC1QOOAFD', '15289JMR215W', '15289JMR215W', '2CQ3MYYBL6AR', '1UR6CB3XVXJS', '4124VDRJ5J8X', '6U0DC1QOOAFD']"

From his exquisite lyric ""To Helen,"" to his immortal masterpieces, ""Annabel Lee,"" ""The Bells,"" and ""The Raven,"" Poe stands beside the celebrated English romantic poets Shelley, Byron, and Keats, and his haunting, sensuous poetic vision profoundly influenced the Victorian giants Swinburne, Tennyson, and Rossetti.  Today his dark side speaks eloquently to contemporary readers in poems such as ""The Haunted Palace"" and ""The Conqueror Worm,"" with their powerful images of madness and the macabre. But even at the end of his life, Poe reached out to his art for comfort and courage, giving us in ""Eldorado"" a talisman to hold during our darkest moments--a timeless gift from a great American writer.

386F69VGZ83S,"His Very Best : Jimmy Carter, a Life (Hardcover)","An intimate portrait of the thirty-ninth president draws on fresh archival material to trace Jimmy Carter's improbable rise from a humble peanut farmer and complex man of faith to an American president and Nobel Prize-winning humanitarian.  From one of America ' s most-respected journalists and modern historians comes the first full-length biography of Jimmy Carter, the thirty-ninth president of the United States and Nobel Prize-winning humanitarian.       Jonathan Alter tells the epic story of an enigmatic man of faith and his improbable journey from barefoot boy to global icon. Alter paints an intimate and surprising portrait of the only president since Thomas Jefferson who can fairly be called a Renaissance Man, a complex figure--ridiculed and later revered--with a piercing intelligence, prickly intensity, and biting wit beneath the patented smile. Here is a moral exemplar for our times, a flawed but underrated president of decency and vision who was committed to telling the truth to the American people.  Growing up in one of the meanest counties in the Jim Crow South, Carter is the only American president who essentially lived in three centuries: his early life on the farm in the 1920s without electricity or running water might as well have been in the nineteenth; his presidency put him at the center of major events in the twentieth; and his efforts on conflict resolution and global health set him on the cutting edge of the challenges of the twenty-first.  Drawing on fresh archival material and five years of extensive access to Carter and his entire family, Alter traces how he evolved from a timid, bookish child--raised mostly by a black woman farmhand--into an ambitious naval nuclear engineer writing passionate, never-before-published love letters from sea to his wife and full partner, Rosalynn; a peanut farmer and civic leader whose guilt over staying silent during the civil rights movement and not confronting the white terrorism around him helped power his quest for racial justice at home and abroad; an obscure, born-again governor whose brilliant 1976 campaign demolished the racist wing of the Democratic Party and took him from zero percent to the presidency; a stubborn outsider who failed politically amid the bad economy of the 1970s and the seizure of American hostages in Iran but succeeded in engineering peace between Israel and Egypt, amassing a historic environmental record, moving the government from tokenism to diversity, setting a new global standard for human rights, and normalizing relations with China among other unheralded and far-sighted achievements. After leaving office, Carter eradicated diseases, built houses for the poor, and taught Sunday school into his mid-nineties.  This engrossing, monumental biography will change our understanding of perhaps the most misunderstood president in American history.• Author: Jonathan Alter • ISBN:9781501125485 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-09-29",https://walmart.com/ip/386F69VGZ83S,Books,/Presidents & Heads of State Biographies & Memoirs,$37.50,0.0,0 ratings,"['7B3AOIO8AW89', '4E43EZ1VDTU1', '5I6N2PCL9OV4', '6PSXHKB3ZQG7', '4ZMD1X0X61TU', '66ULUG3FJGUC', '4BMNJH5NOILZ', '21QZWNMNESHC', '1FB1XUHW0VSK', '5K0TMQUXSQXT', '5K0TMQUXSQXT', '66ULUG3FJGUC', '4BMNJH5NOILZ', '1FB1XUHW0VSK', '21QZWNMNESHC']"

3BPN00T8E7QO,The Detective in the Dooryard : Reflections of a Maine Cop (Hardcover),"The Detective in the Dooryard is composed of stories about the people, places, and things of Maine. There are sad stories, big events, and even the mundane, all told from the perspective of a seasoned police officer and in the wry voice of a lifelong Mainer. Many of the stories will leave you chuckling, some will invariably bring tears to your eyes, but all will leave you with a profound sense of hope and positivity.  Tim Cotton has been a police officer for more than thirty years. The writer in him has always been drawn to the stories of the people he has met along the way. Dealing with the standard issue ne'er-do-wells as a patrol officer, homicide detective, polygraph examiner, and later as the lieutenant in charge of the criminal investigation division certainly provides an interesting backdrop--but more often he writes about the regular folks he encounters, people who need his help, or those who just want to share a joke or even a sad story.

Even after the most devastating events, it is possible to grow by finding deeper meaning and gaining greater appreciation in our lives. Option B illuminates how to help others in crisis, develop compassion for ourselves, raise strong children, and create resilient families, communities, and workplaces. Many of these lessons can be applied to everyday struggles, allowing us to brave whatever lies ahead""--Dust jacket flap.#1 New York Times Best SellerNamed a Best Book of 2017 by Barnes & Noble and Amazon From Facebook’s COO and Wharton’s top-rated professor, the #1 New York Times best-selling authors of Lean In and Originals: a powerful, inspiring, and practical book about building resilience and moving forward after life’s inevitable setbacks.     After the sudden death of her husband, Sheryl Sandberg felt certain that she and her children would never feel pure joy again. “I was in ‘the void,’” she writes, “a vast emptiness that fills your heart and lungs and restricts your ability to think or even breathe.” Her friend Adam Grant, a psychologist at Wharton, told her there are concrete steps people can take to recover and rebound from life-shattering experiences. We are not born with a fixed amount of resilience. It is a muscle that everyone can build.    Option B combines Sheryl’s personal insights with Adam’s eye-opening research on finding strength in the face of adversity. Beginning with the gut-wrenching moment when she finds her husband, Dave Goldberg, collapsed on a gym floor, Sheryl opens up her heart—and her journal—to describe the acute grief and isolation she felt in the wake of his death. But  Option B goes beyond Sheryl’s loss to explore how a broad range of people have overcome hardships including illness, job loss, sexual assault, natural disasters, and the violence of war. Their stories reveal the capacity of the human spirit to persevere . . . and to rediscover joy.  Resilience comes from deep within us and from support outside us. Even after the most devastating events, it is possible to grow by finding deeper meaning and gaining greater appreciation in our lives.  Option B illuminates how to help others in crisis, develop compassion for ourselves, raise strong children, and create resilient families, communities, and workplaces. Many of these lessons can be applied to everyday struggles, allowing us to brave whatever lies ahead. Two weeks after losing her husband, Sheryl was preparing for a father-child activity. “I want Dave,” she cried. Her friend replied, “Option A is not available,” and then promised to help her make the most of Option B.  We all live some form of Option B. This book will help us all make the most of it.",https://walmart.com/ip/51LMI97C1UJS,Books,/Personal Memoirs,$19.71,3.8,6 ratings,"['5YDTYN9HVQF6', '4LTKT4C169FK', '5IQTKSN8EJT3', '2Q5Z7DFTFXL7', '6KZI2IF6L9XI', '3OG5H2YDXP1D', '0RT2JWQAUNTH', '4RJELG0HA5C8', '2P2DZ2FC4O4Z', '27T4IOSHSE1V', '21QZWNMNESHC', '4EU7W7DB5N6A', '53H99WPRW8CJ', '0RT2JWQAUNTH', '3H0XXXALWN07']"

2P6X1KI6VRTE,All Things Possible: Setbacks and Success in Politics and Life (Hardcover),"In this frank memoir--a story of duty, family, justice, politics, and resilience--Andrew Cuomo, New York State's fifty-sixth governor, reflects on his rise, fall, and rise again in politics, and the tough (but necessary) lessons he has learned along the way. Born to first-generation American parents in the working-class neighborhood of Queens, New York, Andrew M. Cuomo grew up in a family anchored by a shared belief in community, hard and honest work, and helping others. His father, Mario, led by example, as a tireless advocate for local residents, instilling in his son a passion for public service. From stapling up posters as a sixteen-year-old during his father's first political campaign to managing at twenty-five Mario's successful 1982 bid for New York State governor, Andrew Cuomo witnessed at a young age the power of politics to effect change for the common good. These experiences, reinforced by deeply held personal values, guided him, from novice campaign manager to visionary reform crusader to Clinton cabinet member--at thirty-nine--to groundbreaking governor of his home state. Laying out his unique approach to challenging the status quo, All Things Possible is not a traditional political memoir, but rather one man's revelatory reflection on a life defined by a commitment to public service, and the hard-won truths gleaned from both his struggles and his successes. In recounting his uphill battles to redefine the way America deals with homelessness, rehabilitate the legislative process in Albany, and bring marriage equality to New York, Cuomo presents an inspiring blueprint for greater political cooperation and efficacy. He also unflinchingly examines his failed 2002 gubernatorial bid, which heralded a dark period of political and personal turmoil, to illustrate why failure is inextricably bound up with success, why we should never forget where we come from, and the importance of balancing personal and professional commitments. And he proves, through all that he's achieved since his victory in the 2010 election, that our biggest triumphs lie not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.

No one else has what you have. No one else can share what you share. Let the World See You is a blueprint for learning how to be yourself and living a life of genuine authenticity from NFL linebacker, speaker, podcaster, and humanitarian Sam Acho.  In Let the World See You, Sam Acho helps you break free from society's perceived limits and embrace the freedom of living as the genuine you. By sharing lessons and interactions with others throughout his life, Acho reveals how you can overcome your fears and discover the freedom of living as the genuine you. Many of us hide in our everyday lives. We put on masks, we play small--and we don't live up to our full potential. Sam Acho was one of those people. After years of hiding behind the ""tough-guy"" footballer persona, the Sam he had become to the world had no connection to the true Sam he knew himself to be. It was only when he lost a friend and mentor that he realized he was doing it all wrong. Like many of us do when we try to be someone we're not, Acho was ignoring the unique gifts, talents, and personality he truly possessed while trying to be what the world wanted him to be.  While sharing personal stories, entertaining anecdotes, and hard-learned lessons, Let the World See You will encourage you to:  - Identify the nature of your fears  - Discover how to take off the masks that hide who you are - Learn to lean on the God who knows you, names you, and loves you You don't have to hide. There is another way of living. Let the world see you. Your quirks, your passions, and your inner desires were not given to you by accident.

15DRUOPXAHQ7,"The Kennedy Heirs : John, Caroline, and the New Generation - A Legacy of Tragedy and Triumph","From New York Times bestselling author J. Randy Taraborrelli comes The Kennedy Heirs, his most revealing Kennedy book yet. A unique burden was inherited by the children of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his celebrated siblings, Senators Robert and Ted Kennedy. Raised in a world of enormous privilege against the backdrop of American history, this third generation of Kennedys often veered between towering accomplishment and devastating defeat. In his revelatory new book, acclaimed Kennedy historian J. Randy Taraborrelli draws back the curtain on the next generation of America's most famous family.  John Kennedy, Jr.'s life in the public eye is explored, following the Kennedy scion as he faced the challenges posed by marrying his great love, Carolyn Bessette. Riveting new details are shared about the couple's tragic demise--and why Ethel Kennedy advised Carolyn not to take the trip that would ultimately end her life. John's sister, Caroline Kennedy, had her own complicated relationships, including a marriage to Ed Schlossberg that surprised her mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and an unexpected bond with her mother-in-law, Mae Schlossberg. Additional stories, many shared here for the first time, illuminate the rest of the Kennedy dynasty: Kara Kennedy, Ted's daughter, and her valiant battle against lung cancer; how Ted's wife, Vicki, introduced a new era of feminism to the Kennedy family; the lifelong struggles with addiction faced by Bobby Kennedy Jr. and Patrick Kennedy; the unexpected way pop star Taylor Swift helped Conor Kennedy heal after the death of his mother, Bobby's wife Mary; and Congressman Joe Kennedy III's rise to prominence. At the center of it all is the family's indomitable matriarch, Ethel Kennedy--a formidable presence with her maddening eccentricities and inspiring courage. Based on hundreds of exclusive first-hand interviews and cultivated over twenty years of research--including numerous Oral Histories from the JFK Library and the Edward M. Kennedy Institute--The Kennedy Heirs is an epic drama of ambition, scandal, pride and power.From New York Times bestselling author J.

6E5JEXE51X4X,"My Dearest, Dearest Albert : Queen Victoria's Life Through Her Letters and Journals","Using excerpts from letters and diaries written by Victoria over many decades, this book shows her very human side, from spirited young princess to caring Queen, passionate bride and loving mother to great-grandmother of a royal dynasty.  Photographs of Queen Victoria most often show a plump Empress wearing widow’s black: serious and regal. In reality, the character of Alexandrina Victoria, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland, and latterly in her long reign, Empress of India, is rather different. In private, Victoria had a reputation for being fun-loving and entertaining. Victoria kept a daily journal from the age of 13, which by the time of her death ran to 122 volumes. She reveals herself to be emotional and honest about her own feelings and experiences, as well as her opinions of other people. This book shows Victoria at her most human, whether enthusing over her hobbies and interests, delighting in her children and grandchildren, commenting on the 10 different Prime Ministers who served during her reign, or sharing her love for her husband—her dearest, dearest Albert.

3AG5VT8OAHC8,The Virginia Dynasty : Four Presidents and the Creation of the American Nation (Hardcover),"A group portrait of America's first four presidents from Virginia focuses on a series of key historical episodes that illustrate how the myriad leadership roles of Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe promoted transcendental, if contradictory, national views about freedom and equality.  A vivid account of leadership focusing on the first four Virginia presidents--George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe--from the bestselling historian and author of James Madison. From a small expanse of land on the North American continent came four of the nation's first five presidents--a geographic dynasty whose members led a revolution, created a nation, and ultimately changed the world. George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe were born, grew to manhood, and made their homes within a sixty-mile circle east of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Friends and rivals, they led in securing independence, hammering out the United States Constitution, and building a working republic. Acting together, they doubled the territory of the United States. From their disputes came American political parties and the weaponizing of newspapers, the media of the day. In this elegantly conceived and insightful new book from bestselling author Lynne Cheney, the four Virginians are not marble icons but vital figures deeply intent on building a nation where citizens could be free.  Focusing on the intersecting roles these men played as warriors, intellectuals, and statesmen, Cheney takes us back to an exhilarating time when the Enlightenment opened new vistas for humankind. But even as the Virginians advanced liberty, equality, and human possibility, they held people in slavery and were slaveholders when they died. Lives built on slavery were incompatible with a free and just society; their actions contradicted the very ideals they espoused. They managed nonetheless to pass down those ideals, and they became powerful weapons for ending slavery. They inspired Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass and today undergird the freest nation on earth.  Taking full measure of strengths and failures in the personal as well as the political lives of the men at the center of this book, Cheney offers a concise and original exploration of how the United States came to be.• Author: Lynne Cheney • ISBN:9781101980040 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-09-22",https://walmart.com/ip/3AG5VT8OAHC8,Books,/Presidents & Heads of State Biographies & Memoirs,$25.75,5.0,1 ratings,"['7B3AOIO8AW89', '4E43EZ1VDTU1', '5I6N2PCL9OV4', '6PSXHKB3ZQG7', '4ZMD1X0X61TU', '4E43EZ1VDTU1', '7EA3KH223ROK', '4ZR1CNDV589L', '6VL0ER0MVYSO', '27B1Z3JVIAS2', '7EA3KH223ROK', '4ZR1CNDV589L', '4E43EZ1VDTU1', '73UFKY7W9WBK', '6VL0ER0MVYSO']"

Walker's work is a corrective biography, intended to dispel the many myths and legends that continue to surround Chopin. Fryderyk Chopin is an intimate look into a dramatic life; of particular focus are Chopin's childhood and youth in Poland, which are brought into line with the latest scholarly findings, and Chopin's romantic life with George Sand, with whom he lived for nine years. Comprehensive and engaging, and written in highly readable prose, the biography wears its scholarship lightly: this is a book suited as much for the professional pianist as it is for the casual music lover. Just as he did in his definitive biography of Liszt, Walker illuminates Chopin and his music with unprecedented clarity in this magisterial biography, bringing to life one of the nineteenth century's most confounding, beloved, and legendary artists.A New York Times Book Review Editors' Choice.

Fryderyk Chopin is an intimate look into a dramatic life; of particular focus are Chopin’s childhood and youth in Poland, which are brought into line with the latest scholarly findings, and Chopin’s romantic life with George Sand, with whom he lived for nine years.Comprehensive and engaging, and written in highly readable prose, the biography wears its scholarship lightly: this is a book suited as much for the professional pianist as it is for the casual music lover. Just as he did in his definitive biography of Liszt, Walker illuminates Chopin and his music with unprecedented clarity in this magisterial biography, bringing to life one of the nineteenth century’s most confounding, beloved, and legendary artists.",https://walmart.com/ip/5J1ZVR1WXAG2,Books,/Composers & Musicians Biographies & Memoirs,$6.99,0.0,0 ratings,"['6IS0XMXCRYNA', '1NAB4PLXEFS8', '5B6XV3QRPT8P', '7FF711SQUSRP', '1CDDZW1BBCVC', '66ULUG3FJGUC', '5BY57Z0GG3S0', '4BMNJH5NOILZ', '5FBI30XVQRG6', '3OG5H2YDXP1D', '1FB1XUHW0VSK', '3OG5H2YDXP1D', '4S3FDIUPVJO6', '66ULUG3FJGUC', '5BY57Z0GG3S0']"

More than fifty years later, this classic wartime memoir is just as gripping as it was then.  Desperate to see action but rejected by both the marines and paratroopers because he was too short, Murphy eventually found a home with the infantry. He fought through campaigns in Sicily, Italy, France, and Germany. Although still under twenty-one years old on V-E Day, he was credited with having killed, captured, or wounded 240 Germans. He emerged from the war as America's most decorated soldier, having received twenty-one medals, including our highest military decoration, the Congressional Medal of Honor.

1D7VMVZUG1BI,Hard to Handle : The Life and Death of the Black Crowes--A Memoir (Paperback),"Black Crowes drummer and cofounder Steve Gorman shares the band's inside story in this behind-the-scenes biography, from their supernova stardom in the '90s to exhilarating encounters with industry legends. For more than two decades, the Black Crowes topped the charts and reigned supreme over the radio waves, even as hair bands, grunge, and hip-hop threatened to dethrone them. With hits like ""Hard to Handle,"" ""She Talks to Angels,"" and ""Remedy,"" their massive success launched them to stardom in the early '90s, earning them a place among rock royalty. They were on the cover of Rolling Stone, MTV played their videos 24/7, and Generation X rediscovered the power of classic rock and blues by digging into multi-platinum classics like Shake Your Money Maker and The Southern Harmony and Musical Companion. But stardom can be fleeting. For the Black Crowes, success slowly dwindled as the band members got caught up in the rock star world and lost sight of their musical ambition. Despite the drinking, drugs, and incessant fighting between Chris and Rich Robinson -- the angriest brothers in rock and roll, with all due respect to Oasis and the Kinks -- the band continued to tour until 2013. On any given night, they could be the best band you ever saw (or the most combative). Then, one last rift caused by Chris Robinson proved insurmountable for the band to survive. After that, the Black Crowes would fly no more. Founding member Steve Gorman was there for all of it -- the coke- and weed-fueled tours; the tumultuous recording sessions; the backstage hangs with legends like Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, and the Rolling Stones. As the band's drummer and voice of reason, he tried to keep the Black Crowes together musically and emotionally. In Hard To Handle -- the first account of this great American rock band's beginning, middle, and end -- Gorman explains just how impossible that job was with great insight, candor, and humor. They don't make bands like the Black Crowes anymore: crazy, brilliant, self-destructive, inspiring, and, ultimately, not built to last. But, man, what a ride it was while it lasted.• Author: Steve Gorman • ISBN:9780306922022 • Format:Paperback • Publication Date:2020-05-26",https://walmart.com/ip/1D7VMVZUG1BI,Books,/Composers & Musicians Biographies & Memoirs,$14.52,0.0,0 ratings,"['6IS0XMXCRYNA', '1NAB4PLXEFS8', '5B6XV3QRPT8P', '7FF711SQUSRP', '1CDDZW1BBCVC', '5FBI30XVQRG6', '4BMNJH5NOILZ', '665G0YTR9R0J', '3FQS1UH54XS8', '4S3FDIUPVJO6', '3FQS1UH54XS8', '665G0YTR9R0J', '4S3FDIUPVJO6', '7EA3KH223ROK', '5FBI30XVQRG6']"

The embodiment of the scholar-athlete, Bud mixes encouragement with intellectual discussions. When Jay reads American philosopher William James for a class at Duke University, his father, a serious student of literature, reads the book, too, and uses its insights to help Jay deal with the challenges of his freshman year. Bud writes about his own challenges, as well, including his debate over whether to accept the Kennedy administration’s invitation to head the President’s Council on Physical Fitness. Jay’s comments about each of these letters provide context and further insight.     College football fans need no introduction to Bud Wilkinson, but few of them know the great University of Oklahoma football coach as a devoted father. In   Dear Jay, Love Bud, Jay Wilkinson, Bud’s younger son, shares forty-seven letters his father wrote to him while he was in college and graduate school. Spanning the early to mid-1960s, these letters reveal Bud’s deep love for his son, as well as the philosophy and values that led to his remarkable success in sports and in life.

His belief that the greatest leaders are not always the most popular made him an unlikely politician even then, but a wonderful role model and interlocutor for his son. Bud’s thoughts on ethics in business and politics are as inspiring today as when he wrote them a half-century ago.

1W9UF3HM7TVA,Hurricanes : A Memoir,"*NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER*  ""A gripping journey.""--People  The highly anticipated memoir from hip-hop icon Rick Ross chronicles his coming of age amid Miami's crack epidemic, his star-studded controversies and his unstoppable rise to fame. Rick Ross is an indomitable presence in the music industry, but few people know his full story. Now, for the first time, Ross offers a vivid, dramatic and unexpectedly candid account of his early childhood, his tumultuous adolescence and his dramatic ascendancy in the world of hip-hop.  Born William Leonard Roberts II, Ross grew up ""across the bridge,"" in a Miami at odds with the glitzy beaches, nightclubs and yachts of South Beach. In the aftermath of the 1980 race riots and the Mariel boatlift, Ross came of age at the height of the city's crack epidemic, when home invasions and execution-style killings were commonplace. Still, in the midst of the chaos and danger that surrounded him, Ross flourished, first as a standout high school football player and then as a dope boy in Carol City's notorious Matchbox housing projects. All the while he honed his musical talent, overcoming setback after setback until a song called ""Hustlin'"" changed his life forever.  From the making of ""Hustlin'"" to his first major label deal with Def Jam, to the controversy surrounding his past as a correctional officer and the numerous health scares, arrests and feuds he had to transcend along the way,  Hurricanes is a revealing portrait of one of the biggest stars in the rap game, and an intimate look at the birth of an artist.• Author: Rick Ross • ISBN:9781335999283 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2019-09-03",https://walmart.com/ip/1W9UF3HM7TVA,Books,/Rap & Hip Hop Music Books,$13.99,5.0,4 ratings,"['7L0O01O9P44G', '4DKVIYMDHZLG', '2AIV4PQWME67', '5ZPL5DPTHE7T', '5VAKFH6PPYXQ', '7FF711SQUSRP', '0TGXW0636DC6', '486ZYE78BSQU', '4CD2MWYSSHA8', '5G93TAAZ3CCL', '29X8JNSDX31S', '7JV97RJD7S81', '19LCVAWBZLEU', '3P85NNO0HVR6', '22HCI7D1K1YA', '29X8JNSDX31S', '7JV97RJD7S81', '1EJFQVOCR5LT', '341N960TYZAJ', '536PVAGRP3O4']"

Newly revised and available in trade paper to coincide with Lionsgate's film release, I Still Believe shares Jeremy Camp's journey of finding hope and healing through life's toughest moments and the songs that came from his journey that have inspired a generation. When Jeremy Camp lost his beloved wife, Melissa, just months after their wedding, the last thing he wanted to do was sing praise to God. But even as he struggled through unimaginable grief and fought to hold on to his faith, God had other plans: Pick up your guitar. I have something for you to write. Jeremy obeyed, pouring out his heart, writing about the hope that God was still there, even in his deepest grief. The song he wrote that day, ""I Still Believe,"" has gone on to inspire millions around the world.  This is the story behind that song and the movie that was inspired by it. It's an inside look at Jeremy's life--from his difficult childhood and teenage years to the tragic passing of Melissa and the spiritual journey that followed, which inspired some of his best-loved songs and led him, eventually, to find love again. I Still Believe is a powerful heart-wrenching book about the strength of undying love and the power of faith.• Author: Jeremy Camp • ISBN:9780785233411 • Format:Paperback • Publication Date:2020-02-18",https://walmart.com/ip/1UMCUEVBR5FL,Books,/Inspirational,$11.59,4.4,7 ratings,"['1UF9Z26IDT5E', '5IQTKSN8EJT3', '26RWI91A9BZN', '7I319J9FCNY7', '59C3HJG39D6A', '39S7HBJXXC81', '4AM6DCKA6V0N', '2LFITDJRW6DK', '5F6DNMHF00QF', '4DXZRAXNOJ21', '17NUCQ5U6X8U', '0YEEOSY6LHTP', '2UUFBD2M1H5H', '22WX658JEFAQ', '40Z926968PZ4', '17NUCQ5U6X8U', '0YEEOSY6LHTP', '22WX658JEFAQ', '59U1ICIVMG61', '2UUFBD2M1H5H']"

In 1999, as the end of an old century loomed, five musicians entered a recording studio in Paris without a deadline. Their band was widely recognized as the best and most forward-thinking in rock, a rarefied status granting them the time, money, and space to make a masterpiece. But Radiohead didn't want to make another rock record. Instead, they set out to create the future. For more than a year, they battled writer's block, inter-band disagreements, and crippling self-doubt. In the end, however, they produced an album that was not only a complete departure from their prior guitar-based rock sound, it was the sound of a new era, and embodied widespread changes catalyzed by emerging technologies just beginning to take hold of the culture. What they created was  Kid A. At the time, Radiohead's fourth album divided critics. Some called it an instant classic; others, including the U.K. music magazine Melody Maker, deemed it ""tubby, ostentatious, self-congratulatory . . . whiny old rubbish."" But two decades later,  Kid A sounds like nothing less than an overture for the chaos and confusion of the twenty-first century. Acclaimed rock critic Steven Hyden digs deep into the songs, history, legacy, and mystique of  Kid A, outlining the album's pervasive influence and impact on culture, in time for its 20th anniversary. Deploying a mix of criticism, journalism, and personal memoir, Hyden skillfully revisits this enigmatic, alluring LP and investigates the many ways in which  Kid A shaped and foreshadowed our world.• Author: Steven Hyden • ISBN:9780306845680 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-09-29",https://walmart.com/ip/2G351PSXA0EB,Books,/21st Century Modern History Books,$20.49,0.0,0 ratings,"['4B4LF8YTC7QU', '53BXFP1XGI2V', '66ULUG3FJGUC', '59U1ICIVMG61', '2G431TLIKMP5', '6U0DC1QOOAFD', '2G431TLIKMP5', '530PY7YWLJ00', '3Y5D7OM6KWLU', '389K507B026X']"

3HLM85M9Q81S,Outspoken: The Olly Neal Story (Paperback),"Born in 1941 on a farm near Marianna in rural eastern Arkansas, Olly Neal Jr. grew up in a large family with parents who insisted on their children getting a good education. Neal had the intellect but not the temperament to be a good student in high school, but a teacher took an interest in him when she saw him steal a book rather than risk his tough-guy reputation if someone saw him checking it out. Neal went on to start and lead the Lee County Cooperative Clinic in Marianna during the 1970s, a turbulent time fraught with conflicts between the white power structure and black citizens seeking their civil rights and increased economic opportunities. (The clinic remains a prominent community health center.) He became the first black district prosecuting attorney in Arkansas, and then served as a circuit court judge and on the Arkansas Court of Appeals. Historian Grif Stockley has characterized Neal as a civil rights activist, political agitator, Arkansas Delta advocate, and ""black devil incarnate"" to many of Marianna's whites. His road to success was not a smooth one, and Neal tells his unique story with humor, candor, and hard-earned wisdom, explaining his rocky journey from hardscrabble beginnings in rural Lee County to the role of prosecutor to the judicial bench. Along the way, many whites saw him as a threat to the established order and many blacks saw him as a traitor who was prosecuting and sitting in judgment of his own people. But Neal emphasized fairness and equal treatment at every opportunity, saying, ""The way I got past all of this was by talking to my people about what I did and why, and by telling them how difficult it was for me. And I think that many folks understood me."" Looking back on these years and the people he met along the way, he offers insights into the traumas of the time and the toll they took on his mental and physical health, as well as the relationships that helped him face these challenges.Born in 1941 on a farm near Marianna in rural eastern Arkansas, Olly Neal Jr. grew up in a large family with parents who insisted on their children getting a good education.

And I think that many folks understood me.” Looking back on these years and the people he met along the way, he offers insights into the traumas of the time and the toll they took on his mental and physical health, as well as the relationships that helped him face these challenges.",https://walmart.com/ip/3HLM85M9Q81S,Books,/Personal Memoirs,$29.95,0.0,0 ratings,"['5YDTYN9HVQF6', '4LTKT4C169FK', '5IQTKSN8EJT3', '2Q5Z7DFTFXL7', '6KZI2IF6L9XI', '5FBI30XVQRG6', '2Q40QRJEOHIB', '7EA3KH223ROK', '1780A7FONUK2', '6Z0XUND557AB', '2Q40QRJEOHIB', '1780A7FONUK2', '6Z0XUND557AB', '7EA3KH223ROK', '22I1TPVSEWLD']"

79A3WKWS0Q3S,Garth Brooks Anthology: The First Five Years (Limited Edition),"The first five years were filled with high adventure, with dreams coming true, with new friendships beginning and old friendships growing. Most of all, though, the years were filled with music being made. We thought about songs night and day, chased the things. I was surrounded by songwriters, musicians, producers, engineers, managers, by people who lived to make music, and we got to see the world through songs. There were a lot of firsts, one after another: First time leaving Oklahoma for Nashville, first time hearing one of our songs on the radio, first time hitting number one. We won’t ever get to go through all those firsts again, but this book is my chance to get together with the people who shared the experiences and together remember how it all went down. This book gathers what comes to our minds when we think of the first five years and the songs that came to life during that time. Inside these pages you’ll find the music that got released in those first five years, five CDs of it. But you’ll also find a few recordings that we’ve never shared, some of my favorites. You’ll find photographs that have never been made public, behind-the-scenes images from before the first record and others from during the journey. There are artifacts from the vaults, things I’ve saved myself, bits and pieces of this history that mean a lot to me. I’ve always wanted to bring people closer to what I saw, what I experienced. This feels like the closest I’ve come to doing just that.

1D8NUNMZT75W,Crow Killer : The Saga of Liver-Eating Johnson (Paperback),"""First Midland Book edition 1983""--Copyright page.  The movie Jeremiah Johnson introduced millions to the legendary mountain man, John Johnson. The real Johnson was a far cry from the Redford version. Standing 6'2"" in his stocking feet and weighing nearly 250 pounds, he was a mountain man among mountain men, one of the toughest customers on the western frontier. As the story goes, one morning in 1847 Johnson returned to his Rocky Mountain trapper's cabin to find the remains of his murdered Indian wife and her unborn child. He vowed vengeance against an entire Indian tribe. Crow Killer tells of that one-man, decades-long war to avenge his beloved. Whether seen as a realistic glimpse of a long ago, fierce frontier world, or as a mythic retelling of the many tales spun around and by Johnson, Crow Killer is unforgettable. This new edition, redesigned for the first time, features an introduction by western frontier expert Nathan E. Bender and a glossary of Indian tribes.• Author: Raymond W Thorp,Robert Bunker • ISBN:9780253020833 • Format:Paperback • Publication Date:2016-01-04",https://walmart.com/ip/1D8NUNMZT75W,Books,/19th Century United States History Books,$13.57,3.5,2 ratings,"['1NRI8D1DS201', '50OBKZY0BP90', '2ATZ5746MXIP', '42T2WJ7ZP5K0', '4FQD1BUESTO0', '30QRM4SOQ02C', '569Q1UY3V5K4', '2KBNVAXG77A0', '5LOTI2TARY2V', '74Z5XPQHQLR8', '2UUFBD2M1H5H', '6U0DC1QOOAFD', '5MURM3IJWM4G', '4E43EZ1VDTU1', '14V7CY3U6ZVM', '2UUFBD2M1H5H', '6U0DC1QOOAFD', '5UYFF3NS54YX', '2N88SJN7CD8R', '4L47KGFWSNWX']"

The thirteen-time Grammy Award--winning rapper is just in his early thirties, but he's already won the Pulitzer Prize for Music, produced and curated the soundtrack of the megahit film  Black Panther, and has been named one of  Time's 100 Influential People. But what's even more striking about the Compton-born lyricist and performer is how he's established himself as a formidable adversary of oppression and force for change. Through his confessional poetics, his politically charged anthems, and his radical performances, Lamar has become a beacon of light for countless people.  Written by veteran journalist and music critic Marcus J. Moore, this is the first biography of Kendrick Lamar. It's the definitive account of his coming-of-age as an artist, his resurrection of two languishing genres (bebop and jazz), his profound impact on a racially fraught America, and his emergence as the bona fide King of Rap.

79FQOYUXLKP4,Do What You Want : The Story of Bad Religion (Hardcover),"""The all-access autobiography of Bad Religion, a Southern Californian institution and one of the most influential and long-standing punk rock bands of all time In 1980, punk was declared dead in New York, done-for in London, banned in Hollywood. And yet just under the radar, the punk rock virus had continued to spread, slowly inching its way through the breezy beach towns of Southern California and into the edgier interior of East LA. Embraced by the skaters and surfers, and hated by just about everyone else, the LA punk scene ebbed and flowed in the early '80s, each wave ushering in an increasingly aggressive cycle of reformers. It was within this hotbed of deliberate dissonance, lyrical intensity, and untapped teen angst that Bad Religion was born. In Do What You Want, the legendary band tells us the story of their success in their own words, from jamming out in a ""hell hole-ish"" garage in the 1980s to headlining sold-out festivals like Coachella, Lollapalooza, Riot Fest, and more. Our principal storytellers are the four voices that define Bad Religion: Greg Gaffin, a Wisconsin kid who sang in the choir and became a punk rock icon while he was still a teenager; Brett Gurewitz, a high school dropout who later founded the infamous indie punk label Epitaph Records, eventually expanding its net and cache to sign legends like Tom Waits and Merle Haggard; Jay Bentley, a surfer and skater who gained recognition as much for his bass skills as for his outlandish onstage antics; and Brian Baker, a hardcore guitarist who joined the band in 1994 and brings a fresh perspective as an intimate outsider. Do What You Want also features additional interviews from former band members and fellow rock stars like Fat Mike (NOFX), Keith Morris (Black Flag and the Circle Jerks), and many more. With hit after hit dominating the radio waves, Bad Religion also paved the way for the punk rock explosion of the 1990s, opening the door for bands like Blink-182, Green Day, and NOFX to reach a wider audience. They showed the world what punk could be, and they continue to spread their message one song, one show, one tour at a time--with no signs of stopping. Do What You Want isn't a book about a band that's sitting on the sofa and rewriting their history. Bad Religion is at the top of their game, one of the last bands standing with legit punk roots, mainstream success, and widespread appeal""--  From their beginnings as teenagers experimenting in a San Fernando Valley garage dubbed ""The Hell Hole"" to headlining major music festivals around the world, Do What You Wanttells the whole story of Bad Religion's 40-year career in irreverent style.   Do What You Want: The Story of Bad Religion reveals the ups and downs of the band's forty-year career. From their beginnings as teenagers jamming in a San Fernando Valley garage dubbed ""The Hell Hole"" to headlining major music festivals around the world,  Do What You Want tells the whole story in irreverent style.  While  Do What You Want tracks down nearly all of Bad Religion's members past and present, the chief storytellers are the four voices that define Bad Religion:  Greg Graffin, a Wisconsin kid who sang in the choir and became an L.A. punk rock icon while he was still a teenager;  Brett Gurewitz, a high school dropout who founded the independent punk label Epitaph Records and went on to become a record mogul;  Jay Bentley, a surfer and skater who gained recognition as much for his bass skills as for his onstage antics; and  Brian Baker, a founding member of Minor Threat who joined the band in 1994 and brings a fresh perspective as an intimate outsider.  With a unique blend of melodic hardcore and thought-provoking lyrics, Bad Religion paved the way for the punk rock explosion of the 1990s, opening the door for bands like NOFX, The Offspring, Rancid, Green Day, and Blink-182 to reach wider audiences.

32S7JLXCIB0J,Journeys North : The Pacific Crest Trail (Paperback),"Here's the next best thing to being on the Pacific Crest Trail yourself! - Richard Louv, author of Our Wild Calling and Last Child in the Woods  2020 Banff Mountain Book Competition Finalist in Adventure Travel  In  Journeys North, legendary trail angel and thru hiker Barney Scout Mann spins a compelling tale of six hikers on the Pacific Crest Trail in 2007 as they walk from Mexico to Canada. This ensemble story unfolds as these half-dozen hikers--including Barney and his wife, Sandy--trod north, slowly forming relationships and revealing their deepest secrets and aspirations. They face a once-in-a-generation drought and early severe winter storms that test their will in this bare-knuckled adventure. In fact, only a third of all the hikers who set out on the trail that year would finish.   As the group approaches Canada, a storm rages. How will these very different hikers, ranging in age, gender, and background, respond to the hardship and suffering ahead of them? Can they all make the final 60-mile push through freezing temperatures, sleet, and snow, or will some reach their breaking point?   Journeys North is a story of grit, compassion, and the relationships people forge when they strive toward a common goal.• Author: Barney Scout Mann • ISBN:9781680513219 • Format:Paperback • Publication Date:2020-08-01",https://walmart.com/ip/32S7JLXCIB0J,Books,"/Hikes & Walks Travel Books, Maps & Guides",$16.44,0.0,0 ratings,"['44AUQ4222OW5', '1O0FPEHYZ3UX', '1Q1NC9GA6YXA', '6V438PBY4DVL', '4YW0BZSCLHMS', '5GMCTEQUWGJ8', '1TWIILU94ZEV', '4G2O1XH7UJ13', '53H99WPRW8CJ', '580UEBTLUPZF', '580UEBTLUPZF', '0XUPO3RQER64', '6DXYSB3QJ5PD', '79HFYEX6KH5S', '14V7CY3U6ZVM']"

23AJWF7IHU3C,"The Crowded Hour : Theodore Roosevelt, the Rough Riders, and the Dawn of the American Century (Paperback)","The ""gripping"" (The Washington Post) story of the most famous regiment in American history: the Rough Riders, a motley group of soldiers led by Theodore Roosevelt, whose daring exploits marked the beginning of American imperialism in the 20th century.  When America declared war on Spain in 1898, the US Army had just 26,000 men, spread around the country--hardly an army at all. In desperation, the Rough Riders were born. A unique group of volunteers, ranging from Ivy League athletes to Arizona cowboys and led by Theodore Roosevelt, they helped secure victory in Cuba in a series of gripping, bloody fights across the island. Roosevelt called their charge in the Battle of San Juan Hill his ""crowded hour""--a turning point in his life, one that led directly to the White House. ""The instant I received the order,"" wrote Roosevelt, ""I sprang on my horse and then my 'crowded hour' began."" As  The Crowded Hour reveals, it was a turning point for America as well, uniting the country and ushering in a new era of global power. ""A revelatory history of America's grasp for power"" ( Kirkus Reviews, starred review).  Both a portrait of these men, few of whom were traditional soldiers, and of the Spanish-American War itself,  The Crowded Hour dives deep into the daily lives and struggles of Roosevelt and his regiment. Using diaries, letters, and memoirs, Risen illuminates an influential moment in American history: a war of only six months' time that dramatically altered the United States' standing in the world. ""Fast-paced, carefully researched...Risen is a gifted storyteller who brings context to the chaos of war.  The Crowded Hour feels like the best type of war reporting--told with a clarity that takes nothing away from the horrors of the battlefield"" ( The New York Times Book Review).• Author: Clay Risen • ISBN:9781501144004 • Format:Paperback • Publication Date:2020-06-16",https://walmart.com/ip/23AJWF7IHU3C,Books,/Wars & Conflicts Military History Books,$15.99,0.0,0 ratings,"['3ZL4WEM4EP9G', '2G7JHJIR53M0', '5UXWFAODO8Y0', '40OL1EX6VJRL', '5DDGB66KUHYQ', '2OY3TWT152Z7', '75UKWQDQ25LZ', '2E3BB2AI80SE', '74Z5XPQHQLR8', '35QSTF3MBHVL', '324T0TEVWL05', '30QRM4SOQ02C', '52S6DJ85ASMS', '5804AQTV4K1J', '2364ZAP5KTH4']"

687GG03E59VQ,The Luckiest Man : Life with John McCain,"A deeply personal and candid remembrance of the late Senator John McCain from one of his closest and most trusted confidants, friends, and political advisors.   More so than almost anyone outside of McCain's immediate family, Mark Salter had unparalleled access to and served to influence the Senator's thoughts and actions, cowriting seven books with him and acting as a valued confidant. Now, in The Luckiest Man, Salter draws on the storied facets of McCain's early biography as well as the later-in-life political philosophy for which the nation knew and loved him, delivering an intimate and comprehensive account of McCain's life and philosophy.   Salter covers all the major events of McCain's life--his peripatetic childhood, his naval service--but introduces, too, aspects of the man that the public rarely saw and hardly knew. Woven throughout this narrative is also the story of Salter and McCain's close relationship, including how they met, and why their friendship stood the test of time in a political world known for its fickle personalities and frail bonds.   Through Salter's revealing portrayal of one of our country's finest public servants, McCain emerges as both the man we knew him to be and also someone entirely new. Glimpses of his restlessness, his curiosity, his courage, and sentimentality are rendered with sensitivity and care--as only Mark Salter could provide. The capstone to Salter's intimate and decades-spanning time with the Senator, The Luckiest Man is the authoritative last word on the stories McCain was too modest to tell himself and an influential life not soon to be forgotten.A deeply personal and candid remembrance of the late Senator John McCain from one of his closest and most trusted confidants, friends, and political advisors.

2C02RZZJX1UT,"An Event, Perhaps : A Biography of Jacques Derrida (Hardcover)","""An introduction to the life and work of the philosopher Jacques Derrida""--  Philosopher, film star, father of ""post truth""--the real story of Jacques Derrida Who is Jacques Derrida? For some, he is the originator of a relativist philosophy responsible for the contemporary crisis of truth. For the far right, he is one of the architects of Cultural Marxism. To his academic critics, he reduced French philosophy to ""little more than an object of ridicule."" For his fans, he is an intellectual rock star who ranged across literature, politics, and linguistics. In  An Event, Perhaps, Peter Salmon presents this misunderstood and misappropriated figure as a deeply humane and urgent thinker for our times.   Born in Algiers, the young Jackie was always an outsider. Despite his best efforts, he found it difficult to establish himself among the Paris intellectual milieu of the 1960s. However, in 1967, he changed the whole course of philosophy: outlining the central concepts of deconstruction. Immediately, his reputation as a complex and confounding thinker was established. Feted by some, abhorred by others, Derrida had an exhaustive breadth of interests but, as Salmon shows, was moved by a profound desire to understand how we engage with each other. It is a theme explored through Derrida's intimate relationships with writers sucheven as Althusser, Genet, Lacan, Foucault, Cixous, and Kristeva.   Accessible, provocative and beautifully written,  An Event, Perhaps will introduce a new readership to the life and work of a philosopher whose influence over the way we think will continue long into the twenty-first century.• Author: Peter Salmon • ISBN:9781788732802 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-10-13",https://walmart.com/ip/2C02RZZJX1UT,Books,/Philosophers Biographies & Memoirs,$22.19,0.0,0 ratings,"['60HJT0DXV2ZQ', '32Z0B2ZHJO9W', '75FTERD5DZY8', '36NR0TCVADG2', '5TRE9EW9EL0G', '40VL2AXAPV5V', '4E43EZ1VDTU1', '21QZWNMNESHC', '5K0TMQUXSQXT', '5GI8ZJ1SM0LC', '21QZWNMNESHC', '5K0TMQUXSQXT', '4E43EZ1VDTU1', '40VL2AXAPV5V', '64PIIXY6XF1L']"

Andrew Cuomo is the protagonist of an ongoing political saga that reads like a novel. In many ways, his rise, fall, and rise again is an iconic story: a young American politician of vaunting ambition, aiming for nothing less than the presidency. Building on his father's political success, a first run for governor in 2002 led to a stinging defeat, and a painful, public divorce from Kerry Kennedy, scion of another political dynasty, Cuomo had to come back from seeming political death and reinvent himself.   He did so, brilliantly, by becoming New York's attorney general, and compiling a record that focused on public corruption. In winning the governorship in 2010, he promised to clean up America's most corrupt legislature. He is blunt and combative, the antithesis of the glad-handing, blow-dried senator or governor who tries to please one and all. He's also proven he can make his legislature work, alternately charming and arm-twisting his colleagues with a talent for political strategy reminiscent of President Lyndon Johnson. Political pundits tend to agree that for Cuomo, a run for the White House is not a question of whether, but when. A no-holds-barred biography of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo.

394QUFZ4RHQV,Rush Across the Decades: Limelight: Rush in the '80s (Series #2) (Hardcover),"This three-part series celebrates Canada's iconic rock band, offering the most comprehensive biography ever, combining cultural context and canon analysis. All based on extensive firsthand interviews with family, friends, musicians, and the boys in the band. Book two covers the height of Rush's popularity and is a look at all their 1980s albums.  Part two of the definitive biography of the rock 'n' roll kings of the North -- covering Rush's most iconic and popular albums, Moving Pictures and Power Windows Includes two full-color photo inserts, with 16 pages of the band on tour and in the studio In the follow-up to Anthem: Rush in the '70s, Martin Popoff brings together canon analysis, cultural context, and extensive firsthand interviews to celebrate Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart at the peak of their persuasive power. Rush was one of the most celebrated hard rock acts of the '80s, and the second book of Popoff's staggeringly comprehensive three-part series takes readers from Permanent Waves to Presto, while bringing new insight to Moving Pictures, their crowning glory. Limelight: Rush in the '80s is a celebration of fame, of the pushback against that fame, of fortunes made -- and spent ... In the latter half of the decade, as Rush adopts keyboard technology and gets pert and poppy, there's an uproar amongst diehards, but the band finds a whole new crop of listeners. Limelight charts a dizzying period in the band's career, built of explosive excitement but also exhaustion, a state that would lead, as the '90s dawned, to the band questioning everything they previously believed, and each member eying the oncoming decade with trepidation and suspicion.• Author: Martin Popoff • ISBN:9781770415362 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-10-13",https://walmart.com/ip/394QUFZ4RHQV,Books,/Composers & Musicians Biographies & Memoirs,$24.72,0.0,0 ratings,"['6IS0XMXCRYNA', '1NAB4PLXEFS8', '5B6XV3QRPT8P', '7FF711SQUSRP', '1CDDZW1BBCVC', '39DTPKDHZW44', '665G0YTR9R0J', '26VWTTA4KZL4', '7B770WSUNVM1', '14V7CY3U6ZVM', '39DTPKDHZW44', '665G0YTR9R0J', '26VWTTA4KZL4', '7B770WSUNVM1', '14V7CY3U6ZVM']"
0TA54UCN5X0C,Respect : The Life of Aretha Franklin,"9780316196819 The definitive biography of the Queen of Soul from acclaimed music writer David Ritz, hailed by Rolling Stone as ""a remarkably complex portrait of Aretha Franklin's music and her tumultuous life.""    Aretha Franklin began life as the golden daughter of a progressive and promiscuous Baptist preacher. Raised without her mother, she was a gospel prodigy who gave birth to two sons in her teens and left them and her native Detroit for New York, where she struggled to find her true voice. It was not until 1967, when a white Jewish producer insisted she return to her gospel-soul roots, that fame and fortune finally came via ""Respect"" and a rapidfire string of hits. She has evolved ever since, amidst personal tragedy, surprise Grammy performances, and career reinventions.    Again and again, Aretha stubbornly finds a way to triumph over troubles, even as they continue to build. Her hold on the crown is tenacious, and in   Respect, David Ritz gives us the definitive life of one of the greatest talents in all American culture.

Empty your mind; be formless, shapeless like water.  Bruce Lee is a cultural icon, renowned the world over for his martial arts and film legacy. But Lee was also a deeply philosophical thinker, learning at an early age that martial arts are more than just an exercise in physical discipline--they are an apt metaphor for living a fully realized life.  Now, in  Be Water, My Friend, Lee's daughter Shannon shares the concepts at the core of his philosophies, showing how they can serve as tools of personal growth and self-actualization. Each chapter brings a lesson from Bruce Lee's teachings, expanding on the foundation of his iconic ""be water"" philosophy. Over the course of the book, we discover how being like water allows us to embody fluidity and naturalness in life, bringing us closer to our essential flowing nature and our ability to be powerful, self-expressed, and free.  Through previously untold stories from her father's life and from her own journey in embodying these lessons, Shannon presents these philosophies in tangible, accessible ways. With Bruce Lee's words as a guide, she encourages readers to pursue their essential selves and apply these ideas and practices to their everyday lives--whether in learning new things, overcoming obstacles, or ultimately finding their true path.   Be Water, My Friend is an inspirational invitation to us all, a gentle call to action to consider our lives with new eyes.

27YFLENLNXB3,The Man Who Ran Washington : The Life and Times of James A. Baker III,"From two of America's most revered political journalists comes the definitive biography of legendary White House chief of staff and secretary of state James A. Baker III: the man who ran Washington when Washington ran the world. For a quarter-century, from the end of Watergate to the aftermath of the Cold War, no Republican won the presidency without his help or ran the White House without his advice. James Addison Baker III was the indispensable man for four presidents because he understood better than anyone how to make Washington work at a time when America was shaping events around the world.  The Man Who Ran Washington is a page-turning portrait of a power broker who influenced America's destiny for generations.  A scion of Texas aristocracy who became George H. W. Bush's best friend on the tennis courts of the Houston Country Club, Baker had never even worked in Washington until a devastating family tragedy struck when he was thirty-nine. Within a few years, he was leading Gerald Ford's campaign and would go on to manage a total of five presidential races and win a sixth for George W. Bush in a Florida recount. He ran Ronald Reagan's White House and became the most consequential secretary of state since Henry Kissinger. He negotiated with Democrats at home and Soviets abroad, rewrote the tax code, assembled the coalition that won the Gulf War, brokered the reunification of Germany and helped bring a decades-long nuclear superpower standoff to an end. Ruthlessly partisan during campaign season, Baker governed as the avatar of pragmatism over purity and deal-making over division, a lost art in today's fractured nation.  His story is a case study in the acquisition, exercise, and preservation of power in late twentieth-century America and the story of Washington and the world in the modern era--how it once worked and how it has transformed into an era of gridlock and polarization. This masterly biography by two brilliant observers of the American political scene is destined to become a classic.From two of America's most revered political journalists comes the definitive biography of legendary White House chief of staff and secretary of state James A.

40SWYMR0GPPJ,Alone at Dawn : Medal of Honor Recipient John Chapman and the Untold Story of the World's Deadliest Special Operations Force,"The New York Times bestselling true account of John Chapman, Medal of Honor recipient and Special Ops Combat Controller, and his heroic one-man stand during the Afghan War, as he sacrificed his life to save the lives of twenty-three comrades-in-arms. In the predawn hours of March 4, 2002, just below the 10,469-foot peak of a mountain in eastern Afghanistan, a fierce battle raged. Outnumbered by Al Qaeda fighters, Air Force Combat Controller John Chapman and a handful of Navy SEALs struggled to take the summit in a desperate bid to find a lost teammate. Chapman, leading the charge, was gravely wounded in the initial assault. Believing he was dead, his SEAL leader ordered a retreat. Chapman regained consciousness alone, with the enemy closing in on three sides. John Chapman's subsequent display of incredible valor -- first saving the lives of his SEAL teammates and then, knowing he was mortally wounded, single-handedly engaging two dozen hardened fighters to save the lives of an incoming rescue squad -- posthumously earned him the Medal of Honor. Chapman is the first airman in nearly fifty years to be given the distinction reserved for America's greatest heroes.  Alone at Dawn is also a behind-the-scenes look at the Air Force Combat Controllers: the world's deadliest and most versatile special operations force, whose members must not only exceed the qualifications of Navy SEAL and Army Delta Force teams but also act with sharp decisiveness and deft precision -- even in the face of life-threatening danger. Drawing from firsthand accounts, classified documents, dramatic video footage, and extensive interviews with leaders and survivors of the operation,  Alone at Dawn is the story of an extraordinary man's brave last stand and the brotherhood that forged him.

3UCVZTTZASPT,"My Life, My Fight : Rising Up from New Zealand to the Okc Thunder (Hardcover)","""Steven Adams overcame extreme odds to become a first-round prospect in the 2013 NBA draft. From there he signed a major contract with the Oklahoma City Thunder--making him New Zealand's highest-paid athlete ever--and went on to forge a reputation for his intense, physical style of basketball. Adams takes you inside the draft process from the fascinating whirlwind tour of pre-draft workouts with dozens of teams to the draft itself where dreams are made or dashed and the Gatorade bottles on every table are glued shut. He reveals what it's like to be a rookie in the league, getting pushed around and elbowed--or worse. He takes the court alongside superstars like Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Carmelo Anthony, and Kevin Durant; and matches up against legendary big men like Tim Duncan, DeAndre Jordan, Dwight Howard, and Draymond Green. Adams recounts the Thunder's rise through the victories and the heartbreaks and how the resilient team has a bright future ahead. In this intimate account of his life story so far, the seven-foot center also reflects on his humble upbringing as one of fourteen children, the impact of his father's death when he was just thirteen, the multiple challenges and setbacks he has faced, and what basketball means to him. Told with warmth, humor, and humility, My Life, My Fight is a gripping account from an emerging superstar.""--Publisher's description.• Author: Steven Adams • ISBN:9780316491464 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2018-10-09",https://walmart.com/ip/3UCVZTTZASPT,Books,/NBA Books,$8.25,0.0,0 ratings,"['3N2P5TFT54DL', '3XEXRMTEASKW', '6EO3WA2LA1GP', '4PHPQMBUNTS9', '7D9MRUIUCN47', '0RV25K618YAP', '1E4V7Y7B9M5M', '581AOY2WAKUV', '5NTYZDTU6WAR', '5C9TXYRIBO61', '1E4V7Y7B9M5M', '0RV25K618YAP', '1Q3IA0JELI6R', '0WQM50LWBHJL', '7JWIR99ZL8HW']"

This book takes the reader from his early social realist murals and easel paintings of the 1930s and 1940s, to the Abstract Expressionist works of the 1950s and early 1960s, and finally to the powerful new language of figurative painting, which he developed in the late 1960s and 1970s.

0SOX1F5VCCDI,Wilco : Learning How to Die,"The intimate story of one of the great American bands of our time, creators of the controversial masterpiece Yankee Hotel Foxtrot When alt-country heroes-turned-rock-iconoclasts Wilco handed in their fourth album,  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, to the band's label, Reprise, a division of Warner Brothers, fans looked forward to the release of another challenging, genre-bending departure from their previous work. The band aimed to build on previous sales and critical acclaim with its boldest and most ambitious album yet, but was instead urged by skittish Reprise execs to make the record more ""radio friendly.""

6PSXHKB3ZQG7,Rage (Hardcover)," An unprecedented and intimate tour de force of original reporting on the Trump presidency from Bob Woodward. Rage goes behind the scenes like never before, with stunning new details about early national security decisions and operations and Trump’s moves as he faces a global pandemic, economic disaster and racial unrest. Woodward, the #1 internationally bestselling author of 13 #1 bestsellers, including Fear: Trump in the White House, shows Trump up close in his entirety before the 2020 presidential election. President Trump has said publicly that Woodward has interviewed him. What is not known is that Trump provided Woodward a window into his mind through a series of exclusive interviews. At key decision points, Rage shows how Trump’s responses to the crises of 2020 were rooted in the instincts, habits and style he developed during his first three years as president. Rage draws from hundreds of hours of interviews with firsthand witnesses, as well as participants’ notes, emails, diaries, calendars and confidential documents. Woodward obtained 25 personal letters exchanged between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that have not been public before. Kim describes the bond between the two leaders as out of a “fantasy film,” as the two leaders engage in an extraordinary diplomatic minuet. Rage will be the foundational account of the Trump presidency, its turmoil, contradictions and risks. It is an essential document for any voter seeking an accurate inside view of the Trump years—volatile and vivid.• Author: Bob Woodward • ISBN:9781982131739 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-09-15",https://walmart.com/ip/6PSXHKB3ZQG7,Gifts & Registry,/Gift Finder,$17.72,4.9,28 ratings,"['5ZMQ93OFUDNT', '6NKF0RK9GHL5', '5DFK50DMDO8X', '37MV7SIG569Z', '4KOTOAEJRAUQ']"

25JFH3OV696T,Eleanor (Hardcover),"Michaelis presents a portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt, America's longest-serving First Lady, an avatar of democracy whose ever-expanding agency as diplomat, activist, and humanitarian made her one of the world's most widely admired and influential women.  Prizewinning bestselling author David Michaelis presents a breakthrough portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt, America's longest-serving First Lady, an avatar of democracy whose ever-expanding agency as diplomat, activist, and humanitarian made her one of the world's most widely admired and influential women.  In the first single-volume cradle-to-grave portrait in six decades, acclaimed biographer David Michaelis delivers a stunning account of Eleanor Roosevelt's remarkable life of transformation. An orphaned niece of President Theodore Roosevelt, she converted her Gilded Age childhood of denial and secrecy into an irreconcilable marriage with her ambitious fifth cousin Franklin. Despite their inability to make each other happy, Franklin Roosevelt transformed Eleanor from a settlement house volunteer on New York's Lower East Side into a matching partner in New York's most important power couple in a generation.  When Eleanor discovered Franklin's betrayal with her younger, prettier social secretary, Lucy Mercer, she offered a divorce and vowed to face herself honestly. Here is an Eleanor both more vulnerable and more aggressive, more psychologically aware and sexually adaptable than we knew. She came to accept FDR's bond with his executive assistant, Missy LeHand; she allowed her children to live their own lives, as she never could; and she explored her sexual attraction to women, among them a star female reporter on FDR's first presidential campaign, and younger men.  Eleanor needed emotional connection. She pursued deeper relationships wherever she could find them. Throughout her life and travels, there was always another person or place she wanted to heal. As FDR struggled to recover from polio, Eleanor became a voice for the voiceless, her husband's proxy in presidential ambition, and then the people's proxy in the White House. Later, she would be the architect of international human rights and world citizen of the Atomic Age, urging Americans to cope with the anxiety of global annihilation by cultivating a ""world mind."" She insisted that we cannot live for ourselves alone but must learn to live together or we will die together.  Drawing on new research, Michaelis's riveting portrait is not just a comprehensive biography of a major American figure, but the story of an American ideal: how our freedom is always a choice.  Eleanor rediscovers a model of what is noble and evergreen in the American character, a model we need today more than ever.• Author: David Michaelis • ISBN:9781439192016 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-10-06",https://walmart.com/ip/25JFH3OV696T,Books,/19th Century United States History Books,$25.17,0.0,0 ratings,"['30QRM4SOQ02C', '569Q1UY3V5K4', '2KBNVAXG77A0', '5LOTI2TARY2V', '74Z5XPQHQLR8', '2CQ3MYYBL6AR', '1UR6CB3XVXJS', '4124VDRJ5J8X', '6U0DC1QOOAFD', '15289JMR215W', '15289JMR215W', '1UR6CB3XVXJS', '2CQ3MYYBL6AR', '4124VDRJ5J8X', '6U0DC1QOOAFD']"

A successful businesswoman shares her story of growing up in the world of NASCAR and the lessons she learned along the way. Just like a racecar as it takes to the track, each of us needs a certain amount of fine-tuning for our journey through life. In Drive, Kelley Earnhardt Miller, daughter of Dale Earnhardt Sr. and sister to Dale Jr., opens up about growing up in the world of NASCAR, sharing the lessons she learned about being a successful business leader and what she discovered, often the hard way, about winning in life.

3DATS4V6Y1E1,Begin Again : James Baldwin's America and Its Urgent Lessons for Our Own (Hardcover),"""James Baldwin grew disillusioned by the failure of the Civil Rights movement to force America to confront its lies about race. In the era of Trump, what can we learn from his struggle? ""Not everything is lost. Responsibility cannot be lost, it can only be abdicated. If one refuses abdication, one begins again."" --James Baldwin We live, according to Eddie S. Glaude, Jr., in the after times, when the promise of Black Lives Matter and the attempt to achieve a new America were challenged by the election of Donald Trump, a racist president whose victory represents yet another failure of America to face the lies it tells itself about race. We have been here before: For James Baldwin, the after times came in the wake of the Civil Rights movement, when a similar attempt to compel a national confrontation with the truth was answered with the murders of Medgar Evers, Malcolm X, and Martin Luther King, Jr. In these years, spanning from the publication of The Fire Next Time in 1963 to that of No Name in the Street in 1972, Baldwin was transformed into a more overtly political writer, a change that came at great professional and personal cost. But from that journey, Baldwin emerged with a sense of renewed purpose about the necessity of pushing forward in the face of disillusionment and despair. In the story of Baldwin's crucible, Glaude suggests, we can find hope and guidance through our own after times, this Trumpian era of shattered promises and white retrenchment. Mixing biography--drawn partially from newly uncovered interviews--with history, memoir, and trenchant analysis of our current moment, Begin Again is Glaude's attempt, following Baldwin, to bear witness to the difficult truth of race in America today. It is at once a searing exploration that lays bare the tangled web of race, trauma, and memory, and a powerful interrogation of what we all must ask of ourselves in order to call forth a new America""--  NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER - James Baldwin grew disillusioned by the failure of the civil rights movement to force America to confront its lies about race. In our own moment, when that confrontation feels more urgently needed than ever, what can we learn from his struggle?  ""In the midst of an ugly Trump regime and a beautiful Baldwin revival, Eddie Glaude has plunged to the profound depths and sublime heights of Baldwin's prophetic challenge to our present-day crisis.""--Cornel West We live, according to Eddie S. Glaude Jr., in a moment when the struggles of Black Lives Matter and the attempt to achieve a new America have been challenged by the election of Donald Trump, a president whose victory represents yet another failure of America to face the lies it tells itself about race.

Just a few years after he almost died from a severe addiction to cocaine and alcohol, a clean and sober Stevie Ray Vaughan was riding high. His last album was his most critically lauded and commercially successful. He had fulfilled a lifelong dream by collaborating with his first and greatest musical hero, his brother Jimmie. His tumultuous marriage was over and he was in a new and healthy romantic relationship. Vaughan seemed poised for a new, limitless chapter of his life and career. Instead, it all came to a shocking and sudden end on August 27, 1990, when he was killed in a helicopter crash following a dynamic performance with Eric Clapton. Just 35 years old, he left behind a powerful musical legacy and an endless stream of What Ifs. In the ensuing 29 years, Vaughan?s legend and acclaim have only grown and he is now an undisputed international musical icon. Despite the cinematic scope of Vaughan?s life and death, there has never been a truly proper accounting of his story. Until now. Texas Flood provides the unadulterated truth about Stevie Ray Vaughan from those who knew him best: his brother Jimmie, his Double Trouble bandmates Tommy Shannon, Chris Layton and Reese Wynans, and many other close friends, family members, girlfriends, fellow musicians, managers and crew members.",https://walmart.com/ip/5QE1NC7Q5NS9,Books,/Composers & Musicians Biographies & Memoirs,$8.76,5.0,2 ratings,"['6IS0XMXCRYNA', '1NAB4PLXEFS8', '5B6XV3QRPT8P', '7FF711SQUSRP', '1CDDZW1BBCVC', '3OG5H2YDXP1D', '5K0TMQUXSQXT', '35696VAFMELU', '74D5DG8BO15U', '4NZ7AINT8YO1', '3OG5H2YDXP1D', '5K0TMQUXSQXT', '35696VAFMELU', '4NZ7AINT8YO1', '66EWM9KN0IQP']"

""I always wanted to punch his face before I read this book.

From growing up in a family of firefighters on Staten Island to commuting three hours a day to high school and ""seeing the sights"" (like watching a Russian woman throw a stroller off the back of a ferry), to attending Harvard while Facebook was created, Jost shares how he has navigated the world like a slightly smarter Forrest Gump.  You'll also discover things about Jost that will surprise and confuse you, like how Jimmy Buffett saved his life, how Czech teenagers attacked him with potato salad, how an insect laid eggs inside his legs, and how he competed in a twenty-five-man match at WrestleMania (and almost won). You'll go behind the scenes at SNL and Weekend Update (where he's written some of the most memorable sketches and jokes of the past fifteen years). And you'll experience the life of a touring stand-up comedian--from performing in rural college cafeterias at noon to opening for Dave Chappelle at Radio City Music Hall.  For every accomplishment (hosting the Emmys), there is a setback (hosting the Emmys). And for every absurd moment (watching paramedics give CPR to a raccoon), there is an honest, emotional one (recounting his mother's experience on the scene of the Twin Towers' collapse on 9/11). Told with a healthy dose of self-deprecation,  A Very Punchable Face reveals the brilliant mind behind some of the dumbest sketches on television, and lays bare the heart and humor of a hardworking guy--with a face you can't help but want to punch.In these hilarious essays, the Saturday Night Live head writer and Weekend Update co-anchor learns how to take a beating.“I always wanted to punch his face before I read this book.

2S21FH6Z9505,Ruth Bader Ginsburg : A Life (Paperback),"NATIONAL BESTSELLER  ""A vivid account of a remarkable life."" --The Washington Post In this comprehensive, revelatory biography--fifteen years of interviews and research in the making--historian Jane Sherron De Hart explores the central experiences that crucially shaped Ginsburg's passion for justice, her advocacy for gender equality, and her meticulous jurisprudence. At the heart of her story and abiding beliefs is her Jewish background, specifically the concept of  tikkun olam, the Hebrew injunction to ""repair the world,"" with its profound meaning for a young girl who grew up during the Holocaust and World War II.   Ruth's journey begins with her mother, who died tragically young but whose intellect inspired her daughter's feminism. It stretches from Ruth's days as a baton twirler at Brooklyn's James Madison High School to Cornell University to Harvard and Columbia Law Schools; to becoming one of the first female law professors in the country and having to fight for equal pay and hide her second pregnancy to avoid losing her job; to becoming the director of the ACLU's Women's Rights Project and arguing momentous anti-sex discrimination cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.   All this, even before being nominated in 1993 to become the second woman on the Court, where her crucial decisions and dissents are still making history. Intimately, personably told, this biography offers unprecedented insight into a pioneering life and legal career whose profound mark on American jurisprudence, American society, and our American character and spirit will reverberate deep into the twenty-first century and beyond.

25JFH3OV696T,Eleanor (Hardcover),"Michaelis presents a portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt, America's longest-serving First Lady, an avatar of democracy whose ever-expanding agency as diplomat, activist, and humanitarian made her one of the world's most widely admired and influential women.  Prizewinning bestselling author David Michaelis presents a breakthrough portrait of Eleanor Roosevelt, America's longest-serving First Lady, an avatar of democracy whose ever-expanding agency as diplomat, activist, and humanitarian made her one of the world's most widely admired and influential women.  In the first single-volume cradle-to-grave portrait in six decades, acclaimed biographer David Michaelis delivers a stunning account of Eleanor Roosevelt's remarkable life of transformation. An orphaned niece of President Theodore Roosevelt, she converted her Gilded Age childhood of denial and secrecy into an irreconcilable marriage with her ambitious fifth cousin Franklin. Despite their inability to make each other happy, Franklin Roosevelt transformed Eleanor from a settlement house volunteer on New York's Lower East Side into a matching partner in New York's most important power couple in a generation.  When Eleanor discovered Franklin's betrayal with her younger, prettier social secretary, Lucy Mercer, she offered a divorce and vowed to face herself honestly. Here is an Eleanor both more vulnerable and more aggressive, more psychologically aware and sexually adaptable than we knew. She came to accept FDR's bond with his executive assistant, Missy LeHand; she allowed her children to live their own lives, as she never could; and she explored her sexual attraction to women, among them a star female reporter on FDR's first presidential campaign, and younger men.  Eleanor needed emotional connection. She pursued deeper relationships wherever she could find them. Throughout her life and travels, there was always another person or place she wanted to heal. As FDR struggled to recover from polio, Eleanor became a voice for the voiceless, her husband's proxy in presidential ambition, and then the people's proxy in the White House. Later, she would be the architect of international human rights and world citizen of the Atomic Age, urging Americans to cope with the anxiety of global annihilation by cultivating a ""world mind."" She insisted that we cannot live for ourselves alone but must learn to live together or we will die together.  Drawing on new research, Michaelis's riveting portrait is not just a comprehensive biography of a major American figure, but the story of an American ideal: how our freedom is always a choice.  Eleanor rediscovers a model of what is noble and evergreen in the American character, a model we need today more than ever.• Author: David Michaelis • ISBN:9781439192016 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-10-06",https://walmart.com/ip/25JFH3OV696T,Books,/19th Century United States History Books,$25.17,0.0,0 ratings,"['30QRM4SOQ02C', '569Q1UY3V5K4', '2KBNVAXG77A0', '5LOTI2TARY2V', '74Z5XPQHQLR8', '2CQ3MYYBL6AR', '1UR6CB3XVXJS', '4124VDRJ5J8X', '6U0DC1QOOAFD', '15289JMR215W', '15289JMR215W', '2CQ3MYYBL6AR', '1UR6CB3XVXJS', '4124VDRJ5J8X', '6U0DC1QOOAFD']"

Since the day they said, ""I do,"" Peggy's previous ""doting"" lifestyle met with her husband John's minimalist ways and became the backdrop for years of adventure and a quirky sense of humor because of their differences. From thoughts of wearing headlamps in the house to save energy, to squeezing out the last drop of toothpaste with a workbench vise, Peggy learned to pick her battles and celebrate the hilarity in each situation.   Once their boys were born, woodstove mishaps and garbage dumping tales were the seed for Mike's obsession with doing dirty jobs and the comical presence he is known for today.   As Mike rose to fame, Peggy was his biggest fan who gave motherly advice and constructive criticism, of course. She baked cookies for Mike to take to Joan Rivers for a Christmas party hostess gift, and even wrote fan letters under faux names and mailed them from different cities to Mike's producer.   By the time Mike hits it big, Peggy and John retire to face more adventures, with a lightning strike in their condo, an elderly friend who ate marijuana leaves, and entering into celebrity status by making Viva paper towel and Lee jeans commercials, plus so much more.   Peggy's stories relive the details that intrigue and entertain old and new fans alike.

5I6N2PCL9OV4,Donald Trump V. the United States: Inside the Struggle to Stop a President (Hardcover),"With unparalleled reporting, a Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times reporter continues to break news about the most important political story of our lives as he chronicles the clash between a president and the officials of his own government who tried to stop him. In the early days of the Trump presidency, the people who work in the institutions that make America America saw Trump up close in the Oval Office and became convinced that they had to stand up to an unbound president. These officials faced a situation without parallel in American history: What do you do, and who do you call, if you are the only one standing between the president, his extraordinary powers, and the abyss?  Michael S. Schmidt's  Donald Trump v. The United States tells the dramatic, high-stakes story of those who felt compelled to confront and try to contain the most powerful man in the world as he shredded norms and sought to expand his power.  Schmidt has broken many of the major stories of the Trump era, from the news of Hillary Clinton's use of a personal email account to the report on former FBI director James Comey's contemporaneous memos of conversations with Trump that led directly to the appointment of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. Now he takes us inside the defining events of the presidency, chronicles them up close, and records the clash between an increasingly emboldened president and those around him, who find themselves trying to thwart the president they had pledged to serve, unsure whether he is acting in the interest of the country, his ego, his family business, or Russia. Through their eyes and ears, we observe an epic struggle.  Drawing on secret FBI and White House documents and confidential sources inside federal law enforcement and the West Wing,  Donald Trump v. The United States is vital journalism, recording the shocking reality of a presidency like no other, a riveting contemporary history, and a lasting account of just how fragile and vulnerable the institutions of American democracy really are.Donald Trump V. the United States: Inside the Struggle to Stop a President (Hardcover)",https://walmart.com/ip/5I6N2PCL9OV4,Books,/Presidents & Heads of State Biographies & Memoirs,$23.83,3.0,1 ratings,"['7B3AOIO8AW89', '4E43EZ1VDTU1', '6PSXHKB3ZQG7', '4ZMD1X0X61TU', '1DN0I73UIILV', '4E43EZ1VDTU1', '583LZY0ALL7L', '7B3AOIO8AW89', '6GEJRDO5T349', '7EA3KH223ROK', '665G0YTR9R0J', '4S3FDIUPVJO6', '4E43EZ1VDTU1', '583LZY0ALL7L', '6GEJRDO5T349']"

Told in hindsight, and through illuminating conversations with Chika herself, this is Albom at his most poignant and vulnerable.Bestselling author Mitch Albom returns to nonfiction for the first time in more than a decade in this poignant memoir that celebrates Chika, a young Haitian orphan whose short life would forever change his heart.Chika Jeune was born three days before the devastating earthquake that decimated Haiti in 2010. She spent her infancy in a landscape of extreme poverty, and when her mother died giving birth to a baby brother, Chika was brought to The Have Faith Haiti Orphanage that Albom operates in Port Au Prince. With no children of their own, the forty-plus children who live, play, and go to school at the orphanage have become family to Mitch and his wife, Janine. Chika's arrival makes a quick impression. Brave and self-assured, even as a three-year-old, she delights the other kids and teachers. But at age five, Chika is suddenly diagnosed with something a doctor there says, ""No one in Haiti can help you with."" Mitch and Janine bring Chika to Detroit, hopeful that American medical care can soon return her to her homeland. Instead, Chika becomes a permanent part of their household, and their lives, as they embark on a two-year, around-the-world journey to find a cure. As Chika's boundless optimism and humor teach Mitch the joys of caring for a child, he learns that a relationship built on love, no matter what blows it takes, can never be lost. Told in hindsight, and through illuminating conversations with Chika herself, this is Albom at his most poignant and vulnerable. Finding Chika is a celebration of a girl, her adoptive guardians, and the incredible bond they formed--a devastatingly beautiful portrait of what it means to be a family, regardless of how it is made.",https://walmart.com/ip/59C3HJG39D6A,Books,/Personal Memoirs,$9.99,5.0,6 ratings,"['3PGAFBMS0Y2O', '1VQIFXSDI5W8', '672FQQ5BH009', '1F4P1ES7K40H', '1U04969KZQRT', '6KNDYZAV46J9', '1PSQS6AFO49C', '5UQQC4WN5JES', '5TBSTXYJQPRD', '17VJM937PJZJ', '5YDTYN9HVQF6', '4LTKT4C169FK', '5IQTKSN8EJT3', '2Q5Z7DFTFXL7', '6KZI2IF6L9XI', '22I1TPVSEWLD', '4S3FDIUPVJO6', '59U1ICIVMG61', '3FQS1UH54XS8', '76R42PRDYV8I', '5NPVTNGE5EV8', '2YGB2KANLFMX', '6QMJPQD4IN5U', '17NUCQ5U6X8U', '1LCGZMMEVI6Y']"

5K0TMQUXSQXT,Let Love Rule (Hardcover),"""I see my story as a suite of songs that have a magical connection. I never understood that connection until I sat down to write. It was then that the magic started to flow.""Let Love Rule is a work of deep reflection. Lenny Kravitz looks back at his life with candor, self-scrutiny, and humor.  ""My life is all about opposites,"" he writes. ""Black and white. Jewish and Christian. The Jackson 5 and Led Zeppelin. I accepted my Gemini soul. I owned it. I adored it. Yins and yangs mingled in various parts of my heart and mind, giving me balance and fueling my curiosity and comfort.""   Let Love Rule covers a vast canvas stretching from Manhattan's Upper East Side, Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant, Los Angeles's Baldwin Hills, Beverly Hills, and finally to France, England and Germany.  It's the story of a wildly creative kid who, despite tough struggles at school and extreme tension at home, finds salvation in music.  We see him grow as a musician and ultimately a master songwriter, producer, and performer. We also see Lenny's spiritual growth--and the powerful way in which spirit informs his music.  The cast of characters surrounding Lenny is extraordinary: his father, Sy, a high-powered news executive; his mother, Roxie Roker, a television star; and Lisa Bonet, the young actress who becomes his muse.  The central character, of course, is Lenny, who, despite his great aspirational energy, turns down record deal after record deal until he finds his true voice.  The creation of that voice, the same voice that is able to declare ""Let Love Rule"" to an international audience, is the very heart of this story.  ""Whether recording, performing, or writing a book,"" says Lenny, ""my art is about listening to the inspiration inside and then sharing it with people. Art must bring the world closer together."" • Author: Lenny Kravitz • ISBN:9781250113085 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-10-06",https://walmart.com/ip/5K0TMQUXSQXT,Books,/Composers & Musicians Biographies & Memoirs,$17.99,0.0,0 ratings,"['6IS0XMXCRYNA', '1NAB4PLXEFS8', '5B6XV3QRPT8P', '7FF711SQUSRP', '1CDDZW1BBCVC', '40VL2AXAPV5V', '5FBI30XVQRG6', '4S5R6N1XEC5G', '74KFQJP0776X', '5RSIWIXH1QQW', '5FBI30XVQRG6', '40VL2AXAPV5V', '4S5R6N1XEC5G', '74KFQJP0776X', '5RSIWIXH1QQW']"

2MWD7Z5Q5NC9,More Myself : A Journey,"An intimate, revealing look at one artist's journey from self-censorship to full expression As one of the most celebrated musicians in the world, Alicia Keys has enraptured the globe with her heartfelt lyrics, extraordinary vocal range, and soul-stirring piano compositions. Yet away from the spotlight, Alicia has grappled with private heartache over the challenging and complex relationship with her father, the people-pleasing nature that characterized her early career, the loss of privacy surrounding her romantic relationships, and the oppressive expectations of female perfection. Since Alicia rose to fame, her public persona has belied a deep personal truth: she has spent years not fully recognizing or honoring her own worth. After withholding parts of herself for so long, she is at last exploring the questions that live at the heart of her story: Who am I, really? And once I discover that truth, how can I become brave enough to embrace it? More Myself is part autobiography, part narrative documentary. Alicia's journey is revealed not only through her own candid recounting, but also through vivid recollections from those who have walked alongside her. The result is a 360-degree perspective on Alicia's path, from her girlhood in Hell's Kitchen and Harlem to the process of growth and self-discovery that we all must navigate. In More Myself,  Alicia shares her quest for truth about herself, her past, and her shift from sacrificing her spirit to celebrating her worth. With the raw honesty that epitomizes Alicia's artistry, More Myself is at once a riveting account and a clarion call to readers: to define themselves in a world that rarely encourages a true and unique identity.An intimate, revealing look at one artist’s journey from self-censorship to full expression As one of the most celebrated musicians in the world, Alicia Keys has enraptured the globe with her heartfelt lyrics, extraordinary vocal range, and soul-stirring piano compositions.

To the world, George and Barbara Bush were America's powerful president and influ-ential first lady. To Jenna Bush Hager, they were her beloved Gampy and Ganny, who taught her about respect, humility, kindness, and living a life of passion and meaning--timeless lessons that continue to guide her.  In Midland, Texas, Jenna's maternal grandparents, Harold and Jenna Welch--Pa and Grammee--a home builder and homemaker, lived a quieter life outside the national spotlight. Yet their influence was no less indelible to their granddaughter. Throughout Jenna's childhood and adolescence, the Welches taught her the name of every star in the sky, the way a dove uses her voice--teaching her to appreciate the beauty in the smallest things. Now the mother of three young children, Jenna pays homage to her grandparents in this collection of heartwarming, intimate personal essays. Filled with love, laughter, and unforgettable stories, Everything Beautiful in Its Time captures the joyous and bittersweet nature of life itself. Jenna reflects on the single year in which she and her family lost Barbara and George H. W. Bush, and Jenna Welch.

4WUE35LL5EBN,Tough Love : My Story of the Things Worth Fighting For,"Recalling pivotal moments from her dynamic career on the front lines of American diplomacy and foreign policy, Susan E. Rice--National Security Advisor to President Barack Obama and US Ambassador to the United Nations--reveals her surprising story with unflinching candor in this New York Times bestseller. Mother, wife, scholar, diplomat, and fierce champion of American interests and values, Susan Rice powerfully connects the personal and the professional. Taught early, with tough love, how to compete and excel as an African American woman in settings where people of color are few, Susan now shares the wisdom she learned along the way.   Laying bare the family struggles that shaped her early life in Washington, DC, she also examines the ancestral legacies that influenced her. Rice's elders--immigrants on one side and descendants of slaves on the other--had high expectations that each generation would rise. And rise they did, but not without paying it forward--in uniform and in the pulpit, as educators, community leaders, and public servants.   Susan too rose rapidly. She served throughout the Clinton administration, becoming one of the nation's youngest assistant secretaries of state and, later, one of President Obama's most trusted advisors.   Rice provides an insider's account of some of the most complex issues confronting the United States over three decades, ranging from ""Black Hawk Down"" in Somalia to the genocide in Rwanda and the East Africa embassy bombings in the late 1990s, and from conflicts in Libya and Syria to the Ebola epidemic, a secret channel to Iran, and the opening to Cuba during the Obama years. With unmatched insight and characteristic bluntness, she reveals previously untold stories behind recent national security challenges, including confrontations with Russia and China, the war against ISIS, the struggle to contain the fallout from Edward Snowden's NSA leaks, the U.S. response to Russian interference in the 2016 election, and the surreal transition to the Trump administration.   Although you might think you know Susan Rice--whose name became synonymous with Benghazi following her Sunday news show appearances after the deadly 2012 terrorist attacks in Libya--now, through these pages, you truly will know her for the first time. Often mischaracterized by both political opponents and champions, Rice emerges as neither a villain nor a victim, but a strong, resilient, compassionate leader.   Intimate, sometimes humorous, but always candid,  Tough Love makes an urgent appeal to the American public to bridge our dangerous domestic divides in order to preserve our democracy and sustain our global leadership.Recalling pivotal moments from her dynamic career on the front lines of American diplomacy and foreign policy, Susan E.

The former director of special events at  Vogue and producer of nine legendary Met Galas, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff met Melania Knauss in 2003 and had a front row seat to the transformation of Donald Trump's then girlfriend from a rough-cut gem to a precious diamond. As their friendship deepened over lunches at Manhattan hot spots, black-tie parties, and giggle sessions in the penthouse at Trump Tower, Wolkoff watched the newest Mrs. Trump raise her son, Barron, and manage her highly scrutinized marriage.  After Trump won the 2016 election, Wolkoff was recruited to help produce the 58th Presidential Inaugu-ration and to become the First Lady's trusted advisor. Melania put Wolkoff in charge of hiring her staff, organizing her events, helping her write speeches, and creating her debut initiatives. Then it all fell apart when she was made the scapegoat for inauguration finance irregularities. Melania could have defended her innocent friend and confidant, but she stood by her man, knowing full well who was really to blame. The betrayal nearly destroyed Wolkoff.  In this candid and emotional memoir, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff takes you into Trump Tower and the White House to tell the funny, thrilling, and heartbreaking story of her intimate friendship with one of the most famous women in the world, a woman few people truly understand.  How did Melania react to the  Access Hollywood tape and her husband's affair with Stormy Daniels? Does she get along well with Ivanka?

As Harper digs deeper into the case, though, the threats against her own life return. The phone call she received was very real. A killer from her past is coming for her.

Nora Guerraoui, a jazz composer, returns home to a small town in the Mojave after hearing that her father, owner of a popular restaurant there, has been killed in a suspicious hit-and-run car accident. Told by multiple narrators--Nora herself, Jeremy (the Iraq war veteran with whom she develops an intimacy), widow Maryam, Efrain (an immigrant witness to the accident who refuses to get involved for fear of deportation), Coleman (the police investigator), and Driss (the dead man himself), The Other Americans deftly explores one family's secrets and hypocrisies even as it offers a portrait of Americans riven by race, class, and religion, living side by side, yet ignorant of the vicissitudes that each tribe, as it were, faces"" -- Provided by publisher. Late one spring night in California, Driss Guerraoui--father, husband, business owner, Moroccan immigrant--is hit and killed by a speeding car. The aftermath of his death brings together a diverse cast of characters: Guerraoui's daughter Nora, a jazz composer returning to the small town in the Mojave she thought she'd left for good; her mother, Maryam, who still pines for her life in the old country; Efraín, an undocumented witness whose fear of deportation prevents him from coming forward; Jeremy, an old friend of Nora's and an Iraqi War veteran; Coleman, a detective who is slowly discovering her son's secrets; Anderson, a neighbor trying to reconnect with his family; and the murdered man himself.  As the characters--deeply divided by race, religion, and class--tell their stories, each in their own voice, connections among them emerge. Driss's family confronts its secrets, a town faces its hypocrisies, and love--messy and unpredictable--is born. Timely, riveting, and unforgettable,  The Other Americans is at once a family saga, a murder mystery, and a love story informed by the treacherous fault lines of American culture.• Author: Laila Lalami • ISBN:9780525436034 • Format:Paperback • Publication Date:2020-03-17",https://walmart.com/ip/7DRFTO2Q2AMC,Books,/Literary Novels,$16.00,0.0,0 ratings,"['3FLVNWRHB0DE', '49CYFFHGWABN', '56UO835WA24I', '0WYIK8BZBTTF', '0Y6SPEE2KP7T', '1TWIILU94ZEV', '5GMCTEQUWGJ8', '1EP5Y8CTH4NW', '14V7CY3U6ZVM', '4F14FXE480NC', '14V7CY3U6ZVM', '63775GSJAGAA', '4F14FXE480NC', '7K3XOTS1ELK2', '5XESQJSR4IN8']"

Her wedding is in seven days. Regan Reilly and her fiance, Jack ""no relation"" Reilly -- head of the NYPD Major Case Squad -- are getting married! Regan had the perfect dress made by two young designers on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Arriving at the bridal salon to pick up her gown, Regan discovers the shop has been broken into, the designers bound and gagged, and wedding dresses for four of the April brides (her dress included) are missing. A fifth dress is in shreds on the floor. Even though it's a week before her wedding, Regan gets on the case, and in the process she meets an unusual mix of brides and grooms-to-be, or -- perhaps ""not-to-be.""

The robber, nicknamed ""The Drip"" by the NYPD because he always strikes during rainstorms, has been eluding the police for months. Jack is determined to crack the case before his upcoming nuptials.

5I6IW76G11WH,Inspector Ian Rutledge Mysteries: The Gate Keeper (Paperback),"On a deserted road, late at night, Scotland Yard's Ian Rutledge encounters a frightened woman standing over a body, launching an inquiry that leads him into the lair of a stealthy killer and the dangerous recesses of his own memories in this twentieth installment of the acclaimed New York Times bestselling series. Hours after his sister's wedding, a restless Ian Rutledge drives aimlessly, haunted by the past, and narrowly misses a motorcar stopped in the middle of a desolate road. Standing beside the vehicle is a woman with blood on her hands and a dead man at her feet. She swears she didn't kill Stephen Wentworth. A stranger stepped out in front of their motorcar, and without warning, fired a single shot before vanishing into the night. But there is no trace of him. And the shaken woman insists it all happened so quickly, she never saw the man's face. Although he is a witness after the fact, Rutledge persuades the Yard to give him the inquiry, since he's on the scene. But is he seeking justice--or fleeing painful memories in London?

When a troubled young man named Billy asks Cormoran Strike to help him investigate a crime he witnessed as a child, the private eye is left deeply troubled. While Billy is obviously mentally distressed and cannot remember many concrete details, there is something sincere about him and his story. But before Strike can question him further, Billy bolts from his office in a panic. Trying to get to the bottom of Billy's story, Strike and Robin Ellacott -- once his assistant, now a partner in the agency -- set off on a twisting trail that leads them through the backstreets of London, into a secretive inner sanctum within Parliament, and to a beautiful but sinister manor house deep in the countryside. And during this labyrinthine investigation, Strike's own life is far from straightforward. His newfound fame as a private eye means he can no longer operate behind the scenes as he once did. Plus, his relationship with his former assistant is more fraught than it ever has been; Robin is now invaluable to Strike in the business, but their personal relationship is much, much trickier than that.

I am a bit at loose ends at the moment. My cook, Queenie, is making my new role as mistress of Eynsleigh something akin to constant torture as Darcy is off on another one of his top secret jaunts. And Grandad is busy helping wayward youths avoid lives of crime. So when my dearest friend, Belinda, inherits an old cottage in Cornwall and begs me to go with her to inspect the property, I jump at the chance.  After a heart-stopping journey in Belinda's beast of a motorcar, we arrive at the creaky old cottage called White Sails and quickly realize that it is completely uninhabitable. Just when I'm starting to wonder if I would have been better off trying to get Queenie to cook a roast that hasn't been burnt beyond all recognition, we meet Rose Summers, a woman Belinda knew as a child when she spent time in Cornwall. Rose invites us to stay at Trewoma Hall, the lovely estate now owned by her husband, Tony.  Belinda confesses that she never liked Rose and had a fling with Tony years ago, so staying with them is far from ideal but beggars can't be choosers as they say. Trewoma is not the idyllic house Belinda remembers. There's something claustrophobic and foreboding about the place. Matters aren't helped by the oppressively efficient housekeeper Mrs. Mannering or by the fact that Tony seems to want to rekindle whatever he and Belinda once had right under his wife's nose.  Our increasingly awkward visit soon turns deadly when a member of the household is found murdered and all clues point to Belinda as the prime suspect. I soon learn that some long buried secrets have come back to haunt those in residence at Trewoma Hall and I'll need to sift through the ruins of their past so Belinda doesn't lose her chance at freedom in the present. . . .Lady Georgiana Rannoch is just back from her honeymoon with dashing Darcy O’Mara when a friend in need pulls her into a twisted Gothic tale of betrayal, deception and, most definitely, murder. . . .

Huffington Post For eons, the city of Troy whose legendary fall was detailed in Homer's Iliad was believed to be myth, until archaeologists in the nineteenth century uncovered its ancient walls buried beneath the sands. If Troy was real, how much of Homer's twin tales of gods and monsters, curses and miracles The Iliad and The Odyssey could also be true and awaiting discovery? In the frozen tundra of Greenland, a group of modern-day researchers stumble on a shocking find: a medieval ship buried a half-mile below the ice. The ship's hold contains a collection of artifacts tools of war dating back to the Bronze Age. Inside the captain's cabin is a clockwork gold map imbedded with an intricate silver astrolabe. Once activated, the moving map traces the path of Odysseus's famous ship as it sailed away from Troy. But the route detours as the map opens to reveal a fiery river leading to a hidden realm underneath the Mediterranean Sea the subterranean world of Tartarus, the Greek name for Hell. When word of Tartarus spreads, the phantasmagoric horrors found in Homer's tales are all too real and whoever possesses them can use their awesome power to control the future of humanity. Now, Sigma Force must prevent a tyrant from igniting a global war and cross the very gates of Hell.

65ARRWFLVJYG,The Living Dead (Hardcover),"""A horror landmark and a work of gory genius.""--Joe Hill, New York Times bestselling author of The FiremanNew York Times bestselling author Daniel Kraus completes George A. Romero's brand-new masterpiece of zombie horror, the massive novel left unfinished at Romero's death!   George A. Romero invented the modern zombie with  Night of the Living Dead, creating a monster that has become a key part of pop culture. Romero often felt hemmed in by the constraints of film-making. To tell the story of the rise of the zombies and the fall of humanity the way it should be told, Romero turned to fiction. Unfortunately, when he died, the story was incomplete.  Enter Daniel Kraus, co-author, with Guillermo del Toro, of the  New York Times bestseller  The Shape of Water (based on the Academy Award-winning movie) and  Trollhunters (which became an Emmy Award-winning series), and author of  The Death and Life of Zebulon Finch (an  Entertainment Weekly Top 10 Book of the Year). A lifelong Romero fan, Kraus was honored to be asked, by Romero's widow, to complete  The Living Dead.  Set in the present day,  The Living Dead is an entirely new tale, the story of the zombie plague as George A. Romero wanted to tell it.   It begins with one body. A pair of medical examiners find themselves battling a dead man who won't stay dead.   It spreads quickly. In a Midwestern trailer park, a Black teenage girl and a Muslim immigrant battle newly-risen friends and family. On a US aircraft carrier, living sailors hide from dead ones while a fanatic makes a new religion out of death. At a cable news station, a surviving anchor keeps broadcasting while his undead colleagues try to devour him. In DC, an autistic federal employee charts the outbreak, preserving data for a future that may never come.  Everywhere, people are targeted by both the living and the dead.  We think we know how this story ends.   We. Are. Wrong. • Author: George A Romero,Daniel Kraus • ISBN:9781250305121 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-08-04",https://walmart.com/ip/65ARRWFLVJYG,Books,/Horror Novels,$20.00,4.0,1 ratings,"['1FCVASC9D4W8', '5PL2YB5ZDVAB', '3KHDVEK12Y92', '6UBNCFC9L888', '64VYMCX68KF9', '26VWTTA4KZL4', '1H5XZ7YGO4Y2', '2RHXB0M0KRH6', '56R4JO71KK12', '5XB9C1JVCNUU', '56R4JO71KK12', '5XB9C1JVCNUU', '3F9SA62O3H3T', '1ZV1TFD6FTDE', '1ROGUMH8RCR5']"

3O05I286VF1C,A Bookish Baker Mystery: Murder Most Sweet : A Bookish Baker Mystery (Series #1) (Hardcover),"In this series debut for fans of Jenn McKinlay, baker Teddie St. John spends her time away from the oven writing murder mysteries. But is she herself a murderer? Everyone in Lake Potawatomi, Wisconsin, knows Teddie St. John. Tall, curly-haired Teddie is a superb baker, a bohemian bon vivant, and a mystery writer. Teddie is walking her American Eskimo dog, Gracie, when her four-legged friend finds Teddie's missing silk scarf. Only problem: the scarf is tied tightly around the neck of a beautiful blond woman, the fiancée of a touring British author.  Before you can say Wisconsin kringle, Teddie becomes a murder suspect. Everyone in town knows all too well that the distinctive scarf was hers. But there are more layers to this case than there would have been on poor Kristi's wedding cake. Tavish Bentley should be bereaved after his sweetheart's strangling. Instead, the dashing Brit takes a shine to Teddie's witty wisecracks and to-die-for cookies, and soon he's mooning over her instead of mourning his bride. That is, when he's not dodging the attentions of Annabelle, an obsessive fan who's taken to stalking him.  And when a second murder shocks the community, the plot thickens to the consistency of fondant as Teddie stands accused of not one, but two, murders. With the help of her friends Sharon and Char, can Teddie clear her name and deliver a killer's just desserts?• Author: Laura Jensen Walker • ISBN:9781643855028 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-09-08",https://walmart.com/ip/3O05I286VF1C,Books,/Traditional Mystery & Detective Books,$20.32,0.0,0 ratings,"['445ZMI6WURJV', '454BS7BU1P45', '1F2EHTP10Q16', '24396UULDDQ9', '2QHZZ41XDEXF', '3SR1ELG3S6NQ', '6JHVLLX7MC2U', '2YW0P91CNIWX', '3BKWXDFD8HZL', '2RXXP15OCCBL', '2RXXP15OCCBL', '1EJFQVOCR5LT', '40Z926968PZ4', '5SZIBBQZHBEO', '4U0LWK01IGU8']"

In the summer of 1973, 21-year-old college student Devin Jones takes a job at Joyland, a North Carolina amusement park. Almost immediately, a boardwalk fortune-teller warns that Devin has ""a shadow"" over him, and that his destiny is intertwined with that of terminally ill Mike Ross, a 10-year-old boy who has ""the sight."" Shortly after Devin meets Mike, Mike makes a cryptic comment: ""It's not white."" This proves a vital clue when Devin begins investigating an unsolved murder committed four years before at the carnival's Horror House, and quickly stumbles into more than he bargained for. King (The Colorado Kid) brings his usual finesse to this tale's mystery elements, and makes Dev's handling of them crucial to the novel's bigger coming-of-age story, in which Dev adapts to the carny life and finds true romance.

When Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes arrive, they find their partnership pulled between youthful pleasures and old sins, hot sun and cool jazz, new affections and enduring loyalties.   Russell falls into easy friendship with an enthralling American couple, Sara and Gerald Murphy, whose golden life on the Riviera has begun to attract famous writers and artists--and some of the scoundrels linked with Monte Carlo's underworld. The Murphy set will go on to inspire everyone from F. Scott Fitzgerald to Pablo Picasso , but in this summer of 1925, their importance for Russell lies in one of their circle's recent additions: the Holmeses' former housekeeper, Mrs. Hudson, who hasn't been seen since she fled England under a cloud of false murder accusations.   When a beautiful young man is found dead in Mrs. Hudson's front room, she becomes the prime suspect in yet another murder. Russell is certain of Mrs. Hudson's innocence; Holmes is not. But the old woman's colorful past has been a source of tension between them before, and now the dangerous players who control Monte Carlo's gilded casinos may stop at nothing to keep the pair away from what Mrs. Hudson's youthful history could bring to light.   The Riviera is a place where treasure can be false, where love can destroy, and where life, as Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes will discover, can be cheap--even when it is made of solid gold.Mary Russell and Sherlock Holmes turn the Riviera upside down to crack their most captivating case yet in the New York Times bestselling series that Lee Child called “the most sustained feat of imagination in mystery fiction today.”   It’s summertime on the Riviera, and the Jazz Age has come to France’s once-sleepy beaches.

While Sturgis has a knack for piecing together the details of a crime, Delaware can decipher the darkest intents driving the most vicious of perpetrators. And there's no better place for the doctor's analytical skills to shine than a rowdy hall full of young men and women intoxicated on life and lust . . . and suddenly faced with the specter of death.

The baffled bride is convinced the stranger snuck in to sabotage her big day--and the groom is sure it's all a dreadful mistake. But Delaware and Sturgis have a hundred guests to question, and a sneaking suspicion that the motive for murder is personal. Now they must separate the sinners from the saints, the true from the false, and the secrets from those keeping them. The party's over--and the hunt for whoever killed it is on.

21HKF6G69UKD,Agent Pendergast: Crooked River (Series #19) (Paperback),"Racing to uncover the mystery of several severed feet found floating in the Gulf of Mexico, Agent Pendergast is faced with the most inexplicable challenge of his career in this installment of the #1 New York Times bestselling series. A startling crime with dozens of victims. Appearing out of nowhere to horrify the quiet resort town of Sanibel Island, Florida, dozens of identical, ordinary-looking shoes float in on the tide and are washed up on the tropical beach--each one with a crudely severed human foot inside.  A ghastly enigma with no apparent solution. Called away from vacation elsewhere in the state, Agent Pendergast reluctantly agrees to visit the crime scene--and, despite himself, is quickly drawn in by the incomprehensible puzzle. An early pathology report only adds to the mystery. With an ocean of possibilities confronting the investigation, no one is sure what happened, why, or from where the feet originated. And they desperately need to know: are the victims still alive?   A worthy challenge for a brilliant mind. In short order, Pendergast finds himself facing the most complex and inexplicable challenge of his career: a tangled thread of evidence that spans seas and traverses continents, connected to one of the most baffling mysteries in modern medical science. Through shocking twists and turns, all trails lead back to a powerful adversary with a sadistic agenda and who--in a cruel irony--ultimately sees in Pendergast the ideal subject for their malevolent research. • Author: Douglas Preston,Lincoln Child • ISBN:9781538702963 • Format:Paperback • Publication Date:2020-09-29",https://walmart.com/ip/21HKF6G69UKD,Books,/Police Procedural Books,$14.44,0.0,0 ratings,"['3ZJJ4MXR2OTT', '18BDVQRWOJGI', '0VK9WJ0FAO5M', '10WD2T1C3QWV', '4CKXQ8ZODV1Z', '29OXLM36T0NW', '4PZOKR6KLJX2', '1EP5Y8CTH4NW', '12EL6D5PRAQM', '0YJWNSJ3SNQN', '0YJWNSJ3SNQN', '3JEH71A11DX4', '5GMCTEQUWGJ8', '3WS0U5VBQC9W', '14V7CY3U6ZVM']"

Nora Guerraoui, a jazz composer, returns home to a small town in the Mojave after hearing that her father, owner of a popular restaurant there, has been killed in a suspicious hit-and-run car accident. Told by multiple narrators--Nora herself, Jeremy (the Iraq war veteran with whom she develops an intimacy), widow Maryam, Efrain (an immigrant witness to the accident who refuses to get involved for fear of deportation), Coleman (the police investigator), and Driss (the dead man himself), The Other Americans deftly explores one family's secrets and hypocrisies even as it offers a portrait of Americans riven by race, class, and religion, living side by side, yet ignorant of the vicissitudes that each tribe, as it were, faces"" -- Provided by publisher. Late one spring night in California, Driss Guerraoui--father, husband, business owner, Moroccan immigrant--is hit and killed by a speeding car. The aftermath of his death brings together a diverse cast of characters: Guerraoui's daughter Nora, a jazz composer returning to the small town in the Mojave she thought she'd left for good; her mother, Maryam, who still pines for her life in the old country; Efraín, an undocumented witness whose fear of deportation prevents him from coming forward; Jeremy, an old friend of Nora's and an Iraqi War veteran; Coleman, a detective who is slowly discovering her son's secrets; Anderson, a neighbor trying to reconnect with his family; and the murdered man himself.  As the characters--deeply divided by race, religion, and class--tell their stories, each in their own voice, connections among them emerge. Driss's family confronts its secrets, a town faces its hypocrisies, and love--messy and unpredictable--is born.

Shot hard and fast into his testicles, atlys helps him forget that he lives in an abandoned Baltimore school, that his roommate exchanges lumps of flesh for drugs at the Kum Den Smokehouse, and that every day is a moldering motley of whores, cuntcutters, and disease. Unfortunately, atlys never helps Perry forget that, even though his older brother died from an atlys overdose, he will never stop being the tortured middle child.  Set in 2099, THE GREEN KANGAROOS explores the disgusting world of Perry's addiction to atlys and the Samson family's addiction to his sobriety.  ""I write junkie fiction.

Rye Mallett, a fearless ""freight dog"" pilot charged with flying cargo to far-flung locations, is rough-spoken and all business, but soft on regulations when they get in the way of meeting a deadline. But above all, he has a rock-solid reputation: he will fly in the foulest weather, day or night, and deliver the goods safely to their destination. So when Rye is asked to fly into a completely fogbound northern Georgia town and deliver a mysterious black box to a Dr. Lambert, he doesn't ask questions.  As Rye's plane nears the isolated landing strip, more trouble than inclement weather awaits him. Greeted with a sabotage attempt on his plane, he has barely recovered from the crash landing when he meets Dr. Brynn O'Neal, who claims she is receiving the box for Dr. Lambert. Though he has a strict ""no-involvement policy"" when it comes to others' problems, Rye finds himself being irresistibly drawn in to the intrigue surrounding his cargo . . . and to the mysterious and alluring Brynn.  Soon Rye and Brynn are in a treacherous forty-eight-hour race to deliver the box.

But as he sees more and more acclaim in print and on television, Marshall discovers that his father is terminally ill, and he must go back to his childhood home--a place he vowed he would never return. Bienville, Mississippi, is no longer the city Marshall remembers. His family's 150-year-old newspaper is failing, and Jet, the love of his youth, has married into the family of Max Matheson, one of a dozen powerful patriarchs who rule the town through the exclusive Bienville Poker Club. To Marshall's surprise, the Poker Club has offered economic salvation to this community, in the form of a billion-dollar Chinese paper mill. But on the verge of the deal's consummation, two deaths rock Bienville to its core, threatening far more than the city's future. Joining forces with his former lover, Marshall begins digging for the truth. But he and Jet soon discover that the soil of Mississippi is a minefield where explosive secrets can be far more destructive than injustice.

Their eyes are open, but their hearts are cold... When a park ranger stumbles across the bodies of Valerie and Tyler Yates by a creek in the small town of Denton, Detective Josie Quinn is first on the scene. Still reeling from the news that her abusive mother is dying, Josie suspects this is more than just accidental poisoning, and she's right: someone jammed a crudely carved pendant necklace down Valerie's throat before she died. Combing the area, Josie's team discover a third sleeping bag indicating there could have been an extra guest around the fire that night. A lucky escape? A missing victim? Or a suspect on the run? Finding this person is the key to the entire investigation... Trawling the couple's photo albums for clues, Josie can't imagine why anyone might want to harm these smiling, carefree young lovers. Until a face in one of the pictures stops her in her tracks and leads her to a farmhouse hidden deep within the forest - a special place where people go to escape, and to hide. There they meet a young girl with frightened eyes and bandaged wrists who knows more than she is saying. But the next day she's found dead, choked with a matching necklace... With her mother's life hanging by a thread, Josie has an impossible decision to make. But first she must find the meaning of the pendant and catch this twisted killer before another innocent life is taken. Is she already too late?

5RO3U3BRWPWI,The Guilty,"After failing a critical assignment overseas, Will Robie must investigate a murder accusation against his father--but to save him, he'll have to face a violent and deadly fallout in this New York Times bestselling thriller. Will Robie escaped his small Gulf Coast hometown of Cantrell, Mississippi after high school, severing all personal ties, and never looked back. Not until the unimaginable occurs. His father, Dan Robie, has been arrested and charged with murder.  Father and son haven't spoken or seen each other since the day Robie left town. In that time, Dan Robie--a local attorney and pillar of the community--has been elected town judge. Despite this, most of Cantrell is aligned against Dan. His guilt is assumed.  To make matters worse, Dan has refused to do anything to defend himself. When Robie tries to help, his father responds only with anger and defiance. Could Dan really be guilty?  With the equally formidable Jessica Reel at his side, Robie ignores his father's wishes and begins his own desperate investigation into the case. But Robie is now a stranger to his hometown, an outsider, a man who has forsaken his past and his family. His attempts to save his father are met with distrust and skepticism...and violence.  Unlike the missions Robie undertook in the service of his country, where his target was clearly defined, digging into his father's case only reveals more questions. Robie is drawn into the hidden underside of Cantrell, where he must face the unexpected and possibly deadly consequences of the long-ago choices made by father and son. And this time, there may be no escape for either of them.After failing a critical assignment overseas, Will Robie must investigate a murder accusation against his father--but to save him, he'll have to face a violent and deadly fallout in this New York Times bestselling thriller.

But in telling Monica who she really is, Olivia would have to betray Catherine's wishes and reveal the story behind Monica's ancestry.

At the local state university, two feuding departments have faced off on the battleground of science and medicine. Each carries their views to extremes that may seem absurd, but highly educated people of sound mind and good intentions can reasonably disagree, right?  Then a renowned and confrontational scholar winds up dead, and Virgil Flowers is brought in to investigate . . . and as he probes the recent ideological unrest, he soon comes to realize he's dealing with people who, on this one particular issue, are functionally crazy.

On an island off the coast of Maine, a man is found dead. There's no identification on the body. Only the dogged work of a pair of local newspapermen and a graduate student in forensics turns up any clues, and it's more than a year before the man is identified. And that's just the beginning of the mystery. Because the more they learn about the man and the baffling circumstances of his death, the less they understand. Was it an impossible crime? Or something stranger still...? No one but Stephen King could tell this story about the darkness at the heart of the unknown and our compulsion to investigate the unexplained. With echoes of Dashiell Hammett's  THE MALTESE FALCON and the work of Graham Greene, one of the world's great storytellers presents a moving and surprising tale whose subject is nothing less than the nature of mystery itself...",https://walmart.com/ip/5PTCVQTOOQF5,Books,/Crime Mystery & Detective Books,$6.68,3.5,55 ratings,"['5VYTNWVVQEWY', '6ZDHHDVPWRUX', '6UBNCFC9L888', '64VYMCX68KF9', '64PIIXY6XF1L', '0Z6ZGV59DKCH', '7598UO08VHVS', '54S874L5KEHK', '5LL2FQLM1DAA', '1FCVASC9D4W8', '1S9OORXWU1O0', '3X7OF3KQADTC', '6TVQR469VTYB', '3KVZODALTLES', '6ZFVUANGXKG2', '13MR2QQNH163', '4VE7USVEBNRO', '467XUFVZT52G', '1EJFQVOCR5LT', '454BS7BU1P45', '3BKWXDFD8HZL', '5XB9C1JVCNUU', '1EJFQVOCR5LT', '36F9TC3R0SPV', '454BS7BU1P45', '4L6EQ4IHOG3G', '3SUS2TYAXEFB', '2PTBILS2D6NI', '3YUD2KSLU6WK', '1Q78J8JMS74G']"

1HSM9XEBDE2I,Santa Monica (Paperback),"A debut novel in the vein of Liane Moriarty and Tom Perrotta, about dark secrets brought to life after the mysterious death of a handsome and charismatic trainer to the elite women in Santa Monica. On the western edge of Los Angeles is the gorgeous beachside city of Santa Monica, where the sun-kissed, wealthy residents seem to inhabit real-life California dreams. When movie-star-handsome heartthrob fitness coach Zack Doheny, is found dead on the floor of his gym, the tragedy shocks the elite community, especially those who'd spent many hours each week exercising with the charismatic trainer.  As the narrative flashes back to the months leading up to Zack's death, it quickly becomes clear that things in this coastal paradise are not as glittering as they seem. Lettie - Zack's secret half-sister and an undocumented housekeeper for the toned, entitled women of Santa Monica - holds her brother responsible for a horrific family accident, and desperately needs his money to prevent her deportation. Regina, type-A exercise addict and entrepreneur, will do anything to get out of debt and to claim Zack for herself. And Mel - a New York City transplant who finds herself forty pounds heavier and far more cynical than the lithe women of Santa Monica - discovers an electric attraction to Zack that threatens to disrupt his bond with Regina and upend Mel's own marriage. As these residents of Santa Monica begin to crack under the stress of their secrets, one question hangs above it all: what really happened to Zack Doheny?  As addictively suspenseful as it is sharply observed, hilarious, and compassionate, Santa Monica is the rare novel that captures readers with propulsive storytelling alongside emotional urgency, irresistible characters, ambitious themes, and a vivid sense of place.• Author: Cassidy Lucas • ISBN:9780063018440 • Format:Paperback • Publication Date:2020-10-06",https://walmart.com/ip/1HSM9XEBDE2I,Books,/Suspense Books,$13.49,0.0,0 ratings,"['3E9ARZHW9B8R', '3UKPDYWXLKWY', '6ZB4EMXPFSIQ', '7ICJX6KOAAY1', '6EK3YNQGXOXZ', '5GMCTEQUWGJ8', '29OXLM36T0NW', '12EL6D5PRAQM', '0YJWNSJ3SNQN', '1EP5Y8CTH4NW', '2AF5CY9N3HEP', '3WS0U5VBQC9W', '1TWIILU94ZEV', '3JEH71A11DX4', '2YJV5NNFK7V3']"

Getting snowed in at a luxurious, rustic ski chalet high in the French Alps doesn't sound like the worst problem in the world. Especially when there's a breathtaking vista, a full-service chef and housekeeper, a cozy fire to keep you warm, and others to keep you company. Unless that company happens to be eight coworkers...each with something to gain, something to lose, and something to hide.  When the cofounder of Snoop, a trendy London-based tech startup, organizes a weeklong trip for the team in the French Alps, it starts out as a corporate retreat like any other: PowerPoint presentations and strategy sessions broken up by mandatory bonding on the slopes. But as soon as one shareholder upends the agenda by pushing a lucrative but contentious buyout offer, tensions simmer and loyalties are tested.

DNA from a 1989 rape and murder matches a 29-year-old convicted rapist. Was he an eight-year-old killer or has something gone terribly wrong in the new Regional Crime Lab? The latter possibility could compromise all of the lab's DNA cases currently in court.  Then Bosch and his partner are called to a death scene fraught with internal politics. Councilman Irvin Irving's son jumped or was pushed from a window at the Chateau Marmont. Irving, Bosch's longtime nemesis, has demanded that Harry handle the investigation.  Relentlessly pursuing both cases, Bosch makes two chilling discoveries: a killer operating unknown in the city for as many as three decades, and a political conspiracy that goes back into the dark history of the police department.In his fierce search for a new case, Detective Harry Bosch discovers a killer hiding behind suspicious DNA evidence -- and a political conspiracy that could destroy the Los Angeles Police Department.

""Terrific...affecting...Grisham has done it again.""--Maureen Corrigan, The Washington Post  ""A suspenseful thriller mixed with powerful themes.""--Associated Press In the small Florida town of Seabrook, a young lawyer named Keith Russo was shot dead at his desk as he worked late one night. The killer left no clues. There were no witnesses, no one with a motive. But the police soon came to suspect Quincy Miller, a young black man who was once a client of Russo's.   Quincy was tried, convicted, and sent to prison for life. For twenty-two years he languished in prison, maintaining his innocence. But no one was listening. He had no lawyer, no advocate on the outside. In desperation, he writes a letter to Guardian Ministries, a small nonprofit run by Cullen Post, a lawyer who is also an Episcopal minister.   Guardian accepts only a few innocence cases at a time. Cullen Post travels the country fighting wrongful convictions and taking on clients forgotten by the system. With Quincy Miller, though, he gets far more than he bargained for. Powerful, ruthless people murdered Keith Russo, and they do not want Quincy Miller exonerated.   They killed one lawyer twenty-two years ago, and they will kill another without a second thought.• Author: John Grisham • ISBN:9780525620945 • Format:Paperback • Publication Date:2020-06-16",https://walmart.com/ip/7ICJX6KOAAY1,Books,/Legal Novels,$7.48,5.0,1 ratings,"['2RJDTLF3GCH3', '5AZOJRWAJ0CY', '6J525JDVKCUC', '6DME5EUW5UF8', '5MCQ0D31GPGH', '7EAWJ5QDW11N', '1AX0NN74XAG7', '3H76W691ZB84', '2XR1JGF67K85', '3VOGOTEOQR0X', '40Z926968PZ4', '4QL4AMCHFEXI', '4U0LWK01IGU8', '1Y3T5RQC8AU3', '6JHVLLX7MC2U', '1Y3T5RQC8AU3', '3T62JIQTA0S2', '6JHVLLX7MC2U', '7AAX959WDS6A', '3SR1ELG3S6NQ']"

271E8Q9DY5EK,The Fix,"In this ""perfect 'fix' for the thriller aficionado"" (Associated Press) and #1 New York Times bestseller, maverick FBI detective Amos Decker must forge an uneasy alliance with the Defense Intelligence Agency to prevent an international incident that could spell the end of the United States as we know it. Amos Decker witnesses a murder just outside FBI headquarters. A man shoots a woman execution-style on a crowded sidewalk, then turns the gun on himself.  Even with Decker's extraordinary powers of observation and deduction, the killing is baffling. Decker and his team can find absolutely no connection between the shooter -- a family man with a successful consulting business -- and his victim, a schoolteacher. Nor is there a hint of any possible motive for the attack.  Enter Harper Brown. An agent of the Defense Intelligence Agency, she orders Decker to back off the case. The murder is part of an open DIA investigation, one so classified that Decker and his team aren't cleared for it.  But they learn that the DIA believes solving the murder is now a matter of urgent national security. Critical information may have been leaked to a hostile government -- or worse, an international terrorist group -- and an attack may be imminent.  Decker's never been one to follow the rules, especially with the stakes so high. Forced into an uneasy alliance with Agent Brown, Decker remains laser focused on only one goal: solving the case before it's too late.

Some of the most prominent folk singers of the twentieth century, including Woody Guthrie, 'Sis Cunningham, Pete Seeger, Lee Hays, Burl Ives, etc., were also political activists with various associations with the American Communist Party. As a consequence, the FBI, along with other governmental and right-wing organizations, were monitoring them, keeping meticulous files running many thousands of pages, and making (and carrying out) plans to purge them from the cultural realm.  In The Folk Singers and the Bureau, Aaron J Leonard draws on an unprecedented array of declassified documents and never before released files to shed light on the interplay between left-wing folk artists and their relationship with the American Communist Party, and how it put them in the US government's repressive cross hairs.  At a time of increasing state surveillance and repression, The Folk Singers and the Bureau shows how the FBI and other governmental agencies have attempted to shape and repress American culture.• Author: Aaron Leonard • ISBN:9781913462000 • Format:Paperback • Publication Date:2020-09-08",https://walmart.com/ip/7GX7702FYMEG,Books,/21st Century United States History Books,$14.40,0.0,0 ratings,"['1PBWG0VVOAE4', '6LXDDTKDRRWO', '3ORT84JFORMD', '57VZHPLHL3WI', '3196JMAPZ9OX', '2E3BB2AI80SE', '2OY3TWT152Z7', '324T0TEVWL05', '29ISL0ZGTJR0', '74Z5XPQHQLR8', '74Z5XPQHQLR8', '30QRM4SOQ02C', '5804AQTV4K1J', '29ISL0ZGTJR0', '75UKWQDQ25LZ']"

0XWI1Z1RWHLV,Fallout : The Hiroshima Cover-up and the Reporter Who Revealed It to the World,"New York Times bestselling author Lesley M.M. Blume reveals how one courageous American reporter uncovered one of the deadliest cover-ups of the 20th century--the true effects of the atom bomb--potentially saving millions of lives.  Just days after the United States decimated Hiroshima and Nagasaki with nuclear bombs, the Japanese surrendered unconditionally. But even before the surrender, the US government and military had begun a secret propaganda and information suppression campaign to hide the devastating nature of these experimental weapons. The cover-up intensified as Occupation forces closed the atomic cities to Allied reporters, preventing leaks about the horrific long-term effects of radiation which would kill thousands during the months after the blast. For nearly a year the cover-up worked--until  New Yorker journalist John Hersey got into Hiroshima and managed to report the truth to the world.  As Hersey and his editors prepared his article for publication, they kept the story secret--even from most of their  New Yorker colleagues. When the magazine published ""Hiroshima"" in August 1946, it became an instant global sensation, and inspired pervasive horror about the hellish new threat that America had unleashed. Since 1945, no nuclear weapons have ever been deployed in war partly because Hersey alerted the world to their true, devastating impact. This knowledge has remained among the greatest deterrents to using them since the end of World War II.  Released on the 75th anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing,  Fallout is an engrossing detective story, as well as an important piece of hidden history that shows how one heroic scoop saved--and can still save--the world.New York Times bestselling author Lesley M.M.

408VEUV3CPYC,The Buried : An Archaeology of the Egyptian Revolution (Paperback),"A National Book Critics Circle Award Finalist Extraordinary...Sensitive and perceptive, Mr. Hessler is a superb literary archaeologist, one who handles what he sees with a bit of wonder that he gets to watch the history of this grand city unfold, one day at a time."" --Wall Street Journal From the acclaimed author of River Town and Oracle Bones, an intimate excavation of life in one of the world's oldest civilizations at a time of convulsive change  Drawn by a fascination with Egypt's rich history and culture, Peter Hessler moved with his wife and twin daughters to Cairo in 2011. He wanted to learn Arabic, explore Cairo's neighborhoods, and visit the legendary archaeological digs of Upper Egypt. After his years of covering China for  The New Yorker, friends warned him Egypt would be a much quieter place. But not long before he arrived, the Egyptian Arab Spring had begun, and now the country was in chaos.  In the midst of the revolution, Hessler often traveled to digs at Amarna and Abydos, where locals live beside the tombs of kings and courtiers, a landscape that they call simply  al-Madfuna the Buried. He and his wife set out to master Arabic, striking up a friendship with their instructor, a cynical political sophisticate. They also befriended Peter's translator, a gay man struggling to find happiness in Egypt's homophobic culture. A different kind of friendship was formed with the neighborhood garbage collector, an illiterate but highly perceptive man named Sayyid, whose access to the trash of Cairo would be its own kind of archaeological excavation. Hessler also met a family of Chinese small-business owners in the lingerie trade; their view of the country proved a bracing counterpoint to the West's conventional wisdom.  Through the lives of these and other ordinary people in a time of tragedy and heartache, and through connections between contemporary Egypt and its ancient past, Hessler creates an astonishing portrait of a country and its people. What emerges is a book of uncompromising intelligence and humanity--the story of a land in which a weak state has collapsed but its underlying society remains in many ways painfully the same. A worthy successor to works like Rebecca West's  Black Lamb and Grey Falcon and Bruce Chatwin's  The Songlines,  The Buried bids fair to be recognized as one of the great books of our time.• Author: Peter Hessler • ISBN:9780525559580 • Format:Paperback • Publication Date:2020-05-19",https://walmart.com/ip/408VEUV3CPYC,Books,/Egypt History Books,$17.99,0.0,0 ratings,"['63G9HDB3PAIP', '29ISL0ZGTJR0', '74Z5XPQHQLR8', '52S6DJ85ASMS', '1TWIILU94ZEV', '52S6DJ85ASMS', '63G9HDB3PAIP', '29ISL0ZGTJR0', '74Z5XPQHQLR8', '5GMCTEQUWGJ8']"

Comedian and civil rights activist Dick Gregory's million-copy-plus bestselling memoir--now in trade paperback for the first time.  ""Powerful and ugly and beautiful...a moving story of a man who deeply wants a world without malice and hate and is doing something about it.""--The New York Times Fifty-five years ago, in 1964, an incredibly honest and revealing memoir by one of the America's best-loved comedians and activists, Dick Gregory, was published. With a shocking title and breathtaking writing, Dick Gregory defined a genre and changed the way race was discussed in America.

30QRM4SOQ02C,The Lincoln Conspiracy : The Secret Plot to Kill America's 16th President--and Why It Failed,"Brad Meltzer and Josh Mensch, the bestselling authors of The First Conspiracy,  which covers the secret plot against George Washington, now turn their attention to a little-known, but true story about a failed assassination attempt on the sixteenth president in The Lincoln Conspiracy.  Everyone knows the story of Abraham Lincoln's assassination in 1865, but few are aware of the original conspiracy to kill him four years earlier in 1861, literally on his way to Washington, D.C., for his first inauguration.  The conspirators were part of a pro-Southern secret society that didn't want an antislavery President in the White House. They planned an elaborate scheme to assassinate the brand new President in Baltimore as Lincoln's inauguration train passed through en route to the Capitol. The plot was investigated by famed detective Allan Pinkerton, who infiltrated the group with undercover agents, including one of the first female private detectives in America.  Had the assassination succeeded, there would have been no Lincoln Presidency, and the course of the Civil War and American history would have forever been altered.Brad Meltzer and Josh Mensch, the bestselling authors of The First Conspiracy, which covers the secret plot against George Washington, now turn their attention to a little-known, but true story about a failed assassination attempt on the sixteenth president in The Lincoln Conspiracy.Everyone knows the story of Abraham Lincoln’s assassination in 1865, but few are aware of the original conspiracy to kill him four years earlier in 1861, literally on his way to Washington, D.C., for his first inauguration.

It was a deeply segregated city, ill at ease with the modern world and yet to adjust to the era of civil rights and racial integration. Stax Records offered an escape from the turmoil of the real world for many soul and blues musicians, with much of the music created there becoming the soundtrack to the civil rights movements.  The book opens with the death of the city's most famous recording artist, Otis Redding, who died in a plane crash in the final days of 1967, and then follows the fortunes of Redding's label, Stax/Volt Records, as its fortunes fall and rise again. But, as the tense year unfolds, the city dominates world headlines for the worst of reasons: the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King.",https://walmart.com/ip/1Q2HYLZC09XQ,Musical Instruments,/Musical Instruction,$14.95,0.0,0 ratings,"['1S3MPLFXK5QI', '2D8GMK1384CO', '3D6NT19FZ9GG', '7FBW6VNHKR50', '49WY8PHPHR12']"

Three Days at the Brink is a masterpiece: elegantly written, brilliantly conceived, and impeccably researched. This book not only sparkles but is destined to be a classic!"" --Jay Winik, bestselling author From the #1 bestselling author and award-winning anchor of Special Report with Bret Baier, comes the gripping lost history of the Tehran Conference, where FDR, Churchill, and Stalin plotted D-Day and the Second World War's endgame. With the fate of World War II in doubt and rumors of a Nazi assassination plot swirling, Franklin Roosevelt risked everything at a clandestine meeting that would change the course of history. November 1943: The Nazis and their Axis allies controlled nearly the entire European continent. Japan dominated the Pacific. Allied successes at Sicily and Guadalcanal had gained them modest ground but at an extraordinary cost. On the Eastern Front, the Soviet Red Army had been bled white. The path of history walked a knife's edge. That same month a daring gambit was hatched that would alter everything. The Big Three--Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin--secretly met for the first time to chart a strategy for defeating Adolf Hitler. Over three days in Tehran, Iran, this trio--strange bedfellows united by their mutual responsibility as heads of the Allied powers--made essential decisions that would direct the final years of the war and its aftermath. Meanwhile, looming over the covert meeting was the possible threat of a Nazi assassination plot, code-named Operation Long Jump.  Before they left Tehran, the three leaders agreed to open a second front in the West, spearheaded by Operation Overload and the D-Day invasion of France at Normandy the following June. They also discussed what might come after the war, including dividing Germany and establishing the United Nations--plans that laid the groundwork for the postwar world order and the Cold War. Bestselling author and Fox News Channel anchor Bret Baier's new epic history, Three Days at the Brink,  centers on these crucial days in Tehran, the medieval Persian city on the edge of the desert. Baier makes clear the importance of Roosevelt, who stood apart as the sole leader of a democracy, recognizing him as the lead strategist for the globe's future--the one man who could ultimately allow or deny the others their place in history. With new details discovered in rarely seen transcripts, oral histories, and declassified State Department and presidential documents from the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library, Baier illuminates the complex character of Roosevelt, revealing a man who grew into his role and accepted the greatest challenge any American president since Lincoln had faced.• Author: Bret Baier,Catherine Whitney • ISBN:9780062905697 • Format:Paperback • Publication Date:2020-09-29",https://walmart.com/ip/2U9PSGRDX3HK,Books,/Strategy in Military History Books,$16.99,0.0,0 ratings,"['4LIX66HG2H8W', '3U9KO3X8AO9K', '6QZI08TXB4DL', '1H65WXZDYYLA', '57K8AU7JB69V', '324T0TEVWL05', '5804AQTV4K1J', '59U4PU1H07EA', '4V0ZVNCOE607', '4EU7W7DB5N6A', '324T0TEVWL05', '5804AQTV4K1J', '4V0ZVNCOE607', '4EU7W7DB5N6A', '3KGJGH7CK5OM']"

Kennedy, and the follow-up to mega-bestselling author Bill O'Reilly's Killing Lincoln More than a million readers have thrilled to Bill O'Reilly's Killing Lincoln, the page-turning work of nonfiction about the shocking assassination that changed the course of American history. Now the iconic anchor of The O'Reilly Factor recounts in gripping detail the brutal murder of John Fitzgerald Kennedy--and how a sequence of gunshots on a Dallas afternoon not only killed a beloved president but also sent the nation into the cataclysmic division of the Vietnam War and its culture-changing aftermath. In January 1961, as the Cold War escalates, John F. Kennedy struggles to contain the growth of Communism while he learns the hardships, solitude, and temptations of what it means to be president of the United States. Along the way he acquires a number of formidable enemies, among them Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, Cuban dictator Fidel Castro, and Allen Dulles, director of the Central Intelligence Agency. In addition, powerful elements of organized crime have begun to talk about targeting the president and his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy. In the midst of a 1963 campaign trip to Texas, Kennedy is gunned down by an erratic young drifter named Lee Harvey Oswald. The former Marine Corps sharpshooter escapes the scene, only to be caught and shot dead while in police custody. The events leading up to the most notorious crime of the twentieth century are almost as shocking as the assassination itself. Killing Kennedy chronicles both the heroism and deceit of Camelot, bringing history to life in ways that will profoundly move the reader.

2WIKTFVNURLF,The Neighborhood Manhattan Forgot : Audubon Park and the Families Who Shaped It (Hardcover),"Audubon Park's journey from farm to cityscape  Audubon Park's journey from farmland to cityscape  The study of Audubon Park's origins, maturation, and disappearance is at root the study of a rural society evolving into an urban community, an examination of the relationship between people and the land they inhabit. When John James Audubon bought fourteen acres of northern Manhattan farmland in 1841, he set in motion a chain of events that moved forward inexorably to the streetscape that emerged seven decades later. The story of how that happened makes up the pages of  The Neighborhood Manhattan Forgot: Audubon Park and the Families Who Shaped It.  With a colorful cast of characters drawn from the upper crust of nineteenth-century New York City, this fully illustrated history peels back the many layers of a rural society evolving into an urban community, enlivened by the people who propelled it forward: property owners, tenants, laborers, and servants. Thoroughly researched through primary and secondary sources, as well as private collections,  The Neighborhood Manhattan Forgot tells the intricate tale of how individual choices in the face of family dysfunction, economic crises, technological developments, and the myriad daily occurrences that elicit personal reflection and change of course pushed Audubon Park forward to the cityscape that distinguishes the neighborhood today.  A longtime evangelist for Manhattan's Audubon Park neighborhood, author Matthew Spady delves deep into the lives of the two families most responsible over time for the anomalous arrangement of today's streetscape: the Audubons and the Grinnells. Buoyed by his extensive research, Spady reveals the darker truth behind John James Audubon (1785-1851), a towering patriarch who consumed the lives of his family members in pursuit of his own goals. He then narrates how fifty years after Audubon's death, George Bird Grinnell (1849-1938) and his siblings found themselves the owners of extensive property that was not yielding sufficient income to pay taxes, insurance, and maintenance. Like the Audubons, they planned an exit strategy for controlled change that would have an unexpected ending.   Beginning with the Audubons' return to America in 1839,  The Neighborhood Manhattan Forgot follows the many twists and turns of the area's path from forest to city, ending in the twenty-first century with the Audubon name repurposed in today's historic district, a multi-ethnic, multi-racial urban neighborhood far removed from the homogeneous, Eurocentric Audubon Park suburb. • Author: Matthew Spady • ISBN:9780823289424 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-09-01",https://walmart.com/ip/2WIKTFVNURLF,Books,/Environmentalists & Naturalists Biographies & Memoirs,$26.95,0.0,0 ratings,"['2DYXM09BOF3A', '5TCNMNMO8GXX', '4GLJBTS38X89', '2GNUUZZ7W5RZ', '19ZQ3YPLOK6H', '583LZY0ALL7L', '78VP06P205MU', '665G0YTR9R0J', '6GEJRDO5T349', '7EA3KH223ROK', '7EA3KH223ROK', '6Z0XUND557AB', '35696VAFMELU', '583LZY0ALL7L', '78VP06P205MU']"

5AMDQLDW3SPF,Henry Adams: History of the United States Vol. 1 1801-1809 (LOA #31) : The Administrations of Thomas Jefferson,"One of the greatest histories ever written in English, Henry Adams's  History of the United States is remarkable for its fullness of detail, its penetrating insight, and above all its strong, lively, and ironic style. First published in nine volumes from 1889 to 1891, this classic work was out of print for several decades until The Library of America reissued it in two volumes: the first volume on the years of Thomas Jefferson's presidency and the second devoted to those of James Madison.  With a cast of characters including Aaron Burr, Napoleon Bonaparte, Albert Gallatin, John Randolph, Toussaint L'Ouverture, and the complex, brilliantly delineated character of Thomas Jefferson, the first volume is unrivaled in its handling of diplomatic intrigue and political factionalism. Upon assuming office, Jefferson discovers that his optimistic laissez-faire principles--designed to prevent American government from becoming a militaristic European ""tyranny""--clash with the realities of European war and American security. The party of small government presides over the Louisiana Purchase, the most extensive use of executive power the country has yet seen. Jefferson's embargo--a high-minded effort at peaceable coercion--breeds corruption and smuggling, and the former defender of states' rights is forced to use federal power to suppress them. The passion for peace and liberty pushes the country toward war.  In the center of these ironic reversals, played out in a Washington full of diplomatic intrigue, is the complex figure of Jefferson himself, part tragic visionary, part comic mock-hero. Like his contemporary Napoleon Bonaparte, he is swept into power by the rising tide of democratic nationalism; unlike Bonaparte, he tries to avert the consequences of the wolfish struggle for power among nation-states.  The grandson of one president and the great-grandson of another, Adams gained access to hitherto secret archives in Europe. The diplomatic documents that lace the history lend a novelistic intimacy to scenes such as Jefferson's conscientious introduction of democratic table manners into stuffily aristocratic state dinner parties. Written in a strong, lively style pointed with Adams's wit, the  History chronicles the consolidation of American character, and poses questions about the future course of democracy.   LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation's literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America's best and most significant writing. The Library of America series includes more than 300 volumes to date, authoritative editions that average 1,000 pages in length, feature cloth covers, sewn bindings, and ribbon markers, and are printed on premium acid-free paper that will last for centuries.One of the greatest histories ever written in English, Henry Adams’s  History of the United States is remarkable for its fullness of detail, its penetrating insight, and above all its strong, lively, and ironic style.

5IJJGR8Y6LC8,Separated : Inside an American Tragedy (Hardcover),"""A deeply reported, newsbreaking account the humanitarian crisis of our time by the journalist who has been at the center of the story: MSNBC correspondent Jacob Soboroff, winner of the 2019 Walter Cronkite Award, offers a chilling expose of the human cost of the Trump administration's border and immigration policies.""--  THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER The award-winning NBC News correspondent lays bare the full truth behind the Trump administration's systematic separation of families at the US-Mexico border The seminal book on the child-separation policy. --Rachel Maddow In June 2018, Donald Trump's most notorious decision as president had secretly been in effect for months before most Americans became aware of the astonishing inhumanity being perpetrated by their own government. Jacob Soboroff was among the first journalists to expose this reality after seeing firsthand the living conditions of the children in custody. His influential series of reports ignited public scrutiny that contributed to the president reversing his own policy and earned Soboroff the Cronkite Award for Excellence in Political Broadcast Journalism and, with his colleagues, the 2019 Hillman Prize for Broadcast Journalism. But beyond the headlines, the complete, multilayered story lay untold. How, exactly, had such a humanitarian tragedy--now deemed ""torture"" by physicians--happened on American soil? Most important, what has been the human experience of those separated children and parents? Soboroff has spent the past two years reporting the many strands of this complex narrative, developing sources from within the Trump administration who share critical details for the first time. He also traces the dramatic odyssey of one separated family from Guatemala, where their lives were threatened by narcos, to seek asylum at the U.S. border, where they were separated--the son ending up in Texas, and the father thousands of miles away, in the Mojave desert of central California. And he joins the heroes who emerged to challenge the policy, and who worked on the ground to reunite parents with children. In this essential reckoning, Soboroff weaves together these key voices with his own experience covering this national issue--at the border in Texas, California, and Arizona; with administration officials in Washington, D.C., and inside the disturbing detention facilities. Separated lays out compassionately, yet in the starkest of terms, its human toll, and makes clear what is at stake in the 2020 presidential election.• Author: Jacob Soboroff • ISBN:9780062992192 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-07-07",https://walmart.com/ip/5IJJGR8Y6LC8,Books,/21st Century United States History Books,$24.99,5.0,2 ratings,"['1PBWG0VVOAE4', '6LXDDTKDRRWO', '0RSFLR1UWD3U', '3ORT84JFORMD', '57VZHPLHL3WI', '25JFH3OV696T', '4124VDRJ5J8X', '2CQ3MYYBL6AR', '1UR6CB3XVXJS', '6U0DC1QOOAFD', '15289JMR215W', '25JFH3OV696T', '4124VDRJ5J8X', '2CQ3MYYBL6AR', '1UR6CB3XVXJS']"
6GB5P0KBIP5X,The Invaded (Paperback),"In 1912 the United States sent troops into a Nicaraguan civil war, solidifying a decades-long era of military occupations in Latin America driven by the desire to rewrite the political rules of the hemisphere. In this definitive account of the resistance to the three longest occupations-in Nicaragua, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic-Alan McPherson analyzes these events from the perspective of the invaded themselves, showing why people resisted and why the troops eventually left.  Confronting the assumption that nationalism primarily drove resistance, McPherson finds more concrete-yet also more passionate-motivations: hatred for the brutality of the marines, fear of losing land, outrage at cultural impositions, and thirst for political power. These motivations blended into a potent mix of anger and resentment among both rural and urban occupied populations. Rejecting the view that Washington withdrew from Latin American occupations for moral reasons, McPherson details how the invaded forced the Yankees to leave, underscoring day-to-day resistance and the transnational network that linked New York, Havana, Mexico City, and other cities. Political culture, he argues, mattered more than military or economic motives, as U.S. marines were determined to transform political values and occupied peoples fought to conserve them. Occupiers tried to speed up the modernization and centralization of these poor, rural societies and, ironically, to build nationalism where they found it lacking.  Based on rarely seen documents in three languages and five countries, this lively narrative recasts the very nature of occupation as a colossal tragedy, doomed from the outset to fail. In doing so, it offers broad lessons for today's invaders  and invaded.

4AF1R5AYAQ85,The Vampire : A New History (Paperback),"Published to mark the bicentenary of John Polidori's publication of The Vampyre, Nick Groom's detailed new account illuminates the complex history of the iconic creature. The vampire first came to public prominence in the early eighteenth century, when Enlightenment science collided with Eastern European folklore and apparently verified outbreaks of vampirism, capturing the attention of medical researchers, political commentators, social theorists, theologians, and philosophers. Groom accordingly traces the vampire from its role as a monster embodying humankind's fears, to that of an unlikely hero for the marginalized and excluded in the twenty-first century. Drawing on literary and artistic representations, as well as medical, forensic, empirical, and sociopolitical perspectives, this rich and eerie history presents the vampire as a strikingly complex being that has been used to express the traumas and contradictions of the human condition. Published to mark the bicentenary of John Polidori's publication of  The Vampyre,  Nick Groom's new and authoritative account illuminates the complex history of the iconic creature, tracing its development from Enlightenment-era embodiment of human fears to an unlikely present-day hero of the marginalized and excluded.• Author: Nick Groom • ISBN:9780300254839 • Format:Paperback • Publication Date:2020-09-15",https://walmart.com/ip/4AF1R5AYAQ85,Books,/Social History Books,$13.22,0.0,0 ratings,"['33VZTF3S9PF8', '7DH3N6BB48IO', '4PEU935A6IKH', '6BHAGLLWDPAF', '7AP3S1DNKW3N', '2UUFBD2M1H5H', '63G9HDB3PAIP', '35QSTF3MBHVL', '29ISL0ZGTJR0', '75UKWQDQ25LZ', '29ISL0ZGTJR0', '75UKWQDQ25LZ', '2UUFBD2M1H5H', '63G9HDB3PAIP', '35QSTF3MBHVL']"
23VYD5OR01U5,The Life of Henry VII (Paperback),"Composed between 1500 and 1502, ""The Life of Henry VII"" is the first ""official"" Tudor account of the triumph of Henry VII over Richard III. Its author, the French humanist Bernard Andre, was a poet and historian at the court of Henry VII and tutor to the young Prince Arthur. Steeped in classical literature and familiar with all the tropes of the ancient biographical tradition, Andre filled his account with classical allusions, invented speeches, and historical set pieces. Although cast as a biography, the work dramatizes the dynastic shift that resulted from Henry Tudor's seizure of the English throne at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 and the death of Richard III. Its author had little interest in historical ""facts,"" and when he was uncertain about details, he simply left open space in the manuscript for later completion. He focused instead on the nobility of Henry VII's lineage, the moral character of key figures, and the hidden workings of history. Andre's account thus reflects the impact of new humanist models on English historiography. It is the first extended argument for Henry's legitimate claims to the English crown. ""The Life of Henry VII"" survives in a single manuscript, edited by James Gairdner in the nineteenth-century Rolls Series. It occupies an important place in the literary tradition of treatments of Richard III, begun by Andre, continued by Thomas More and Polydore Vergil, and reaching its classic expression in Shakespeare.

Small Victorian cottages with electric lights and running water were built by Nelson's company and sold at near cost to promote home ownership. The innovative Leclaire factory buildings were described by reporter Nellie Bly as the ""ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in,"" and workers were eligible for pension and profit-sharing opportunities. An educational building and clubhouse provided venues for a variety of programs including a kindergarten, guest speakers, social clubs, and concerts. A baseball diamond, bowling alley, and boating lake were also available to residents. Nelson believed that conflicts between labor and capital could be resolved if his workers' lives were fulfilling.

This history concerns the wars with the Native Americans, as the United States expanded westward and sought to exert its control over greater portions of North America. The hostilities narrated include some of the most famous actions such as the campaign of Little Big Horn, and some of the most famous figures in the conflicts such as Sitting Bull, a Lakota Sioux chieftain whose famous resistance stalled efforts of the USA. Some of the principle skirmishes, such as The Battle of the Rosebud, are expertly narrated with the use of sources from both sides. The famous General Custer, whose untimely death - in an event often called Custer's Last Stand - is treated incisively, with comment upon the tactics that prefaced the General's demise. First published in 1904, this book has the benefit of close proximity to the events described. Among other sources Cyrus Townsend Brady contacted many soldiers, most of whom were in retirement, to ensure his accounts were factual and exact. The author wanted not simply to summarize a vast, decades-long series of warring conflicts, but also to make a meaningful addition to the existing body of work on the subject.

2PS5NW9E43EJ,"Rogue Heroes : The History of the SAS, Britain's Secret Special Forces Unit That Sabotaged the Nazis and Changed the Nature of War","The incredible untold story of WWII's greatest secret fighting force, as told by our great modern master of wartime intrigue Britain's Special Air Service--or SAS--was the brainchild of David Stirling, a young, gadabout aristocrat whose aimlessness in early life belied a remarkable strategic mind. Where most of his colleagues looked at a battlefield map of World War II's African theater and saw a protracted struggle with Rommel's desert forces, Stirling saw an opportunity: given a small number of elite, well-trained men, he could parachute behind enemy lines and sabotage their airplanes and war material. Paired with his constitutional opposite, the disciplined martinet Jock Lewes, Stirling assembled a revolutionary fighting force that would upend not just the balance of the war, but the nature of combat itself. He faced no little resistance from those who found his tactics ungentlemanly or beyond the pale, but in the SAS's remarkable exploits facing the Nazis in the Africa and then on the Continent can be found the seeds of nearly all special forces units that would follow.  Bringing his keen eye for psychological detail to a riveting wartime narrative, Ben Macintyre uses his unprecedented access to SAS archives to shine a light inside a legendary unit long shrouded in secrecy. The result is not just a tremendous war story, but a fascinating group portrait of men of whom history and country asked the most.The incredible untold story of WWII’s greatest secret fighting force, as told by our great modern master of wartime intrigue   Britain’s Special Air Service—or SAS—was the brainchild of David Stirling, a young, gadabout aristocrat whose aimlessness in early life belied a remarkable strategic mind.

7G7VDNHGP6JN,"JFK : Coming of Age in the American Century, 1917-1956 (Hardcover)","""By the time of his assassination in 1963, John F. Kennedy stood at the helm of the greatest power the world had ever seen, a booming American nation he had steered through some of the most perilous diplomatic standoffs of the Cold War era. Born in 1917 to a striving Irish American family that had ascended the ranks of Boston's labyrinthine political machine, Kennedy was bred for government, and his meteoric rise to become the youngest president ever cemented his status as one of the most mythologized political figures in American history. And yet, in the decades since his untimely death, hagiographic portrayals of his dazzling charisma, reports of his extramarital affairs, and disagreements over his political legacy have made our 35th president more mysterious than ever--a problem further exacerbated by the fact that no genuinely comprehensive account of his life has yet been attempted. Beckoned by this gap in our historical knowledge, Fredrik Logevall has spent seven years searching for the ""real"" JFK. The result of this prodigious effort is a sweeping two-volume biography that, for the first time, properly contextualizes Kennedy amidst the roiling American Century. Beginning with the three generations of Kennedy men and women who transformed the clan from working-class Irish immigrants to members of Boston's political elite, Volume One spans the first thirty-nine years of JFK's life, from sickly second son to restless Harvard undergraduate and World War II hero, through his ascendance on Capitol Hill and, finally, his decision to run for president. In chronicling Kennedy's extraordinary life and times, Logevall offers the clearest portrait we have of an iconic, yet still elusive, American president.""--]cProvided by publisher.  A Pulitzer Prize-winning historian takes us as close as we have ever been to the real John F. Kennedy in this revelatory biography of the iconic, yet still elusive, thirty-fifth president.   ""An utterly incandescent study of one of the most consequential figures of the twentieth century.""--Jill Lepore, author of These Truths: A History of the United States By the time of his assassination in 1963, John F. Kennedy stood at the helm of the greatest power the world had ever seen, a booming American nation that he had steered through some of the most perilous diplomatic standoffs of the Cold War. Born in 1917 to a striving Irish American family that had become among Boston's wealthiest, Kennedy knew political ambition from an early age, and his meteoric rise to become the youngest elected president cemented his status as one of the most mythologized figures in American history. And while hagiographic portrayals of his dazzling charisma, reports of his extramarital affairs, and disagreements over his political legacy have come and gone in the decades since his untimely death, these accounts all fail to capture the full person.  Beckoned by this gap in our historical knowledge, Fredrik Logevall has spent much of the last decade searching for the ""real"" JFK. The result of this prodigious effort is a sweeping two-volume biography that properly contextualizes Kennedy amidst the roiling American Century. This volume spans the first thirty-nine years of JFK's life--from birth through his decision to run for president--to reveal his early relationships, his formative experiences during World War II, his ideas, his writings, his political aspirations. In examining these pre-White House years, Logevall shows us a more serious, independently minded Kennedy than we've previously known, whose distinct international sensibility would prepare him to enter national politics at a critical moment in modern U.S. history.  Along the way, Logevall tells the parallel story of America's midcentury rise. As Kennedy comes of age, we see the charged debate between isolationists and interventionists in the years before Pearl Harbor; the tumult of the Second World War, through which the United States emerged as a global colossus; the outbreak and spread of the Cold War; the domestic politics of anti-Communism and the attendant scourge of McCarthyism; the growth of television's influence on politics; and more.   JFK: Coming of Age in the American Century, 1917-1956 is a sweeping history of the United States in the middle decades of the twentieth century, as well as the clearest portrait we have of this enigmatic American icon.• Author: Fredrik Logevall • ISBN:9780812997132 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-09-08",https://walmart.com/ip/7G7VDNHGP6JN,Books,/Presidents & Heads of State Biographies & Memoirs,$32.21,0.0,0 ratings,"['7B3AOIO8AW89', '4E43EZ1VDTU1', '5I6N2PCL9OV4', '6PSXHKB3ZQG7', '4ZMD1X0X61TU', '665G0YTR9R0J', '2AK0LJZ6JZBL', '40VL2AXAPV5V', '6Z0XUND557AB', '3FQS1UH54XS8', '3FQS1UH54XS8', '1FB1XUHW0VSK', '665G0YTR9R0J', '2AK0LJZ6JZBL', '40VL2AXAPV5V']"

The strength and prestige of the American presidency has waxed and waned since George Washington. Eight men have succeeded to the presidency when the incumbent died in office. In one way or another they vastly changed our history. Only Theodore Roosevelt would have been elected in his own right. Only TR, Truman, Coolidge, and LBJ were re-elected.   John Tyler succeeded William Henry Harrison who died 30 days into his term. He was kicked out of his party and became the first president threatened with impeachment.  Millard Fillmore succeeded esteemed General Zachary Taylor. He immediately sacked the entire cabinet and delayed an inevitable Civil War by standing with Henry Clay’s compromise of 1850.  Andrew Johnson, who succeeded our greatest president, sided with remnants of the Confederacy in Reconstruction.  Chester Arthur, the embodiment of the spoils system, was so reviled as James Garfield’s successor that he had to defend himself against plotting Garfield’s assassination; but he reformed the civil service.  Theodore Roosevelt broke up the trusts.  Calvin Coolidge silently cooled down the Harding scandals and preserved the White House for the Republican Herbert Hoover and the Great Depression.  Harry  Truman surprised everybody when he succeeded the great FDR and proved an able and accomplished president.  Lyndon B. Johnson was named to deliver Texas electorally.

34F0BUVGYV93,Preflood to Nimrod to Exodus: Nimrod : The Tower of Babel by Trey Smith (Paperback) (Series #2) (Paperback),"Nimrod: The Tower of Babel is likely one of the BEST PRESENTATION on Nimrod and the Tower of Babel ever in print. In this book, we use actual Sumerian texts, artifacts, and the Biblical account to bring Nimrod, Noah and the Tower of Babel to life. This is a full color, high definition imagery book by Trey Smith.  Nimrod: The Tower of Babel is likely one of the BEST PRESENTATION on Nimrod and the Tower of Babel ever put together in print. This book is fully illustrated with charts, timelines, actual archaeological sites, explanation of the ""gods,"" the summoning of the Enki at the Tower of Babel, the matching of the Sumerian texts with the Biblical texts, and the list goes on....  This book uses a combination of Hebrew texts, the Book of Genesis, the Book of Jasher, the Book of Enoch, the Eridu Genesis, the Epic of Gilgamesh, and other documents translated into laymen's terms with epic imagery and actual artifacts to bring Nimrod and his Tower of Babel to life in a way that has never been done before.  You will learn about the area at the base of Mount Ararat where Noah's ark landed; thus the reason Nimrod calls Noah the ""Lord of Aratta."" You will learn about Nimrod trying to get support for his Tower of Babel from his great grandfather Noah. You will learn about Nimrod's Tower of Babel falling at the time he is going to do war with his great grandfather Noah. You will learn how in the Sumerian texts (the oldest on earth) that Nimrod (called ""Enmerkar"" which means ""mighty hunter"") states that he attempted to provide high quality beer to his great grandfather Noah on one occasion. You will also learn that Nimrod (Enmerkar) claims Noah kept the high quality beer of Uruk and ancient Eridu; yet still refused to support his Tower and told Nimrod to ""get his life straight."" You will further learn that later Nimrod also claims and believes it is Noah (and those with him) who are releasing living dinosaurs (dragons) on him and his men. Nimrod essientially never does get his life straight, and also can never get over his Tower of Babel, and the shame his grandfather Ham put on his life.  These are from actual Sumerian documents that you have likely never heard before.  And, that is just where we begin....  This is the real life account of Nimrod and Noah. A story of ""good"" vs. ""evil."" It is a story, even from the pagan side, about faith vs. Nimrod's arrogance and pride. It is all done through actual ancient texts, actual documents and actual artifacts in HD imagery.  Easy enough for a 5th grader and intellectually satisfying enough for any Phd.. Also, it looks nice on a coffee table and can lighten the atmosphere of any room for leisure reads.  A true story about the largest Nimrod that ever lived.

You won't forget these people soon, and you are bound to emerge from DePalma's bighearted account with a deeper understanding of a storied island . . . A remarkably revealing glimpse into the world of a muzzled yet irrepressibly ebullient neighbor.--The New York Times Modern Cuba comes alive in a vibrant portrait of a group of families's varied journeys in one community over the last twenty years.  Cubans today, most of whom have lived their entire lives under the Castro regime, are hesitantly embracing the future. In his new book, Anthony DePalma, a veteran reporter with years of experience in Cuba, focuses on a neighborhood across the harbor from Old Havana to dramatize the optimism as well as the enormous challenges that Cubans face: a moving snapshot of Cuba with all its contradictions as the new regime opens the gate to the capitalism that Fidel railed against for so long.  In Guanabacoa, longtime residents prove enterprising in the extreme. Scrounging materials in the black market, Cary Luisa Limonta Ewen has started her own small manufacturing business, a surprising turn for a former ranking member of the Communist Party. Her good friend Lili, a loyal Communist, heads the neighborhood's watchdog revolutionary committee. Artist Arturo Montoto, who had long lived and worked in Mexico, moved back to Cuba when he saw improving conditions but complains like any artist about recognition. In stark contrast, Jorge García lives in Miami and continues to seek justice for the sinking of a tugboat full of refugees, a tragedy that claimed the lives of his son, grandson, and twelve other family members, a massacre for which the government denies any role. In  The Cubans, many patriots face one new question: is their loyalty to the revolution, or to their country?  As people try to navigate their new reality, Cuba has become an improvised country, an old machine kept running with equal measures of ingenuity and desperation. A new kind of revolutionary spirit thrives beneath the conformity of a half century of totalitarian rule. And over all of this looms the United States, with its unpredictable policies, which warmed towards its neighbor under one administration but whose policies have now taken on a chill reminiscent of the Cold War.• Author: Anthony Depalma • ISBN:9780525522447 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-05-26",https://walmart.com/ip/24YMBMR4NVEK,Books,/Caribbean & Latin American Political Books,$21.49,0.0,0 ratings,"['2JNQYOWTY840', '3IMM25JBRP52', '7B770WSUNVM1', '27B1Z3JVIAS2', '6NF97RQAA6BT', '2JNQYOWTY840', '6NF97RQAA6BT', '1LE9QELULLW9', '6TVQR469VTYB', '2GS2VBFL37BY']"

The story of David's life and rise from modest beginnings is one of the most celebrated in the Old Testament tradition. This book is an attempt by F. B. Meyer to tell the story of David with a sequential and lively narrative, with the Bible as a source. Meyer's account is readable, colorful and thoroughly rooted in the authentic Biblical canon. We first see David as a bright, courageous young lad, who ascends from obscurity to fame and renown by fighting and defeating the great Goliath. Not merely a great leader, David takes to authoring a great series of sacred songs and hymns celebrating life and the Lord.

1B336YOFZO7K,"Plantagenet Queens & Consorts : Family, Duty and Power (Paperback)","New B-format paperback edition. The lives and political influence of twelve Plantagenet queens and consorts; the female DNA of a dynasty and 250 years of English history. What unacknowledged theme can be found across 250 years of English history? What thread runs throughout the Plantagenet Royal House, including as it does the 'cadet' houses of Lancaster and York, to the beginning of the Modern Period in 1485? It is the influence on events of the royal women; in particular, the queens. Without children, there is no dynasty, no 'house'. Plantagenet Queens and Consorts examines the lives and influence of ten figures, comparing their different approaches to the maintenance of political power in what is always described as a man's world. On the contrary, there is strong evidence to suggest that these women had more political impact than those who came later - with the exception of Elizabeth I - right up to the present day. Beginning with Eleanor of Provence, loyal spouse of Henry III, the author follows the thread of queenship: Philippa of Hainault, Joan of Navarre, Katherine Valois, Elizabeth Woodville, and others, to Henry VII's Elizabeth of York. These are not marginal figures. Arguably, the 'She-Wolf', Isabella of France, had more impact on the history of England than her husband Edward II. Elizabeth of York was the daughter, sister, niece, wife, and mother of successive kings of England. As can be seen from the names, several are ostensibly 'outsiders' twice over, as female and foreign. With specially commissioned photographs of locations and close examination of primary sources, Steven Corvi provides a new and invigorating perspective on medieval English (and European) history.• Author: Steven J Corvi • ISBN:9781445699158 • Format:Paperback • Publication Date:2020-09-15",https://walmart.com/ip/1B336YOFZO7K,Books,/Medieval History Books,$16.10,0.0,0 ratings,"['79V0GS3MIBB8', '5A3IXOSCLCUX', '12ROPUJVQR9C', '4IWGTBC8S9WP', '4OAZ9SAWBUYC', '583LZY0ALL7L', '17NUCQ5U6X8U', '79HFYEX6KH5S', '4F14FXE480NC', '4EU7W7DB5N6A', '5GMCTEQUWGJ8', '2P2DZ2FC4O4Z', '4WSJHZB8RV5U', '3WTEXLMIHC0O', '5MURM3IJWM4G']"

5LOTI2TARY2V,Andrew Jackson and the Miracle of New Orleans : The Battle That Shaped America's Destiny (Paperback),"Another history pageturner from the authors of the #1 bestsellers George Washington's Secret Six and Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates. The War of 1812 saw America threatened on every side. Encouraged by the British, Indian tribes attacked settlers in the West, while the Royal Navy terrorized the coasts. By mid-1814, President James Madison's generals had lost control of the war in the North, losing battles in Canada. Then British troops set the White House ablaze, and a feeling of hopelessness spread across the country.  Into this dire situation stepped Major General Andrew Jackson. A native of Tennessee who had witnessed the horrors of the Revolutionary War and Indian attacks, he was glad America had finally decided to confront repeated British aggression. But he feared that President Madison's men were overlooking the most important target of all: New Orleans.  If the British conquered New Orleans, they would control the mouth of the Mississippi River, cutting Americans off from that essential trade route and threatening the previous decade's Louisiana Purchase. The new nation's dreams of western expansion would be crushed before they really got off the ground.  So Jackson had to convince President Madison and his War Department to take him seriously, even though he wasn't one of the Virginians and New Englanders who dominated the government. He had to assemble a coalition of frontier militiamen, French-speaking Louisianans, Cherokee and Choctaw Indians, freed slaves, and even some pirates. And he had to defeat the most powerful military force in the world--in the confusing terrain of the Louisiana bayous.  In short, Jackson needed a miracle. The local Ursuline nuns set to work praying for his outnumbered troops. And so the Americans, driven by patriotism and protected by prayer, began the battle that would shape our young nation's destiny.  As they did in their two previous bestsellers, Kilmeade and Yaeger make history come alive with a riveting true story that will keep you turning the pages. You'll finish with a new understanding of one of our greatest generals and a renewed appreciation for the brave men who fought so that America could one day stretch ""from sea to shining sea.""Another history pageturner from the authors of the #1 bestsellers George Washington's Secret Six and Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates.The War of 1812 saw America threatened on every side.

1TYCNX8GC7IZ,P.S.: The Gulag Archipelago 1918-1956 Abridged : An Experiment in Literary Investigation (Paperback),"Translation of: Arkhipelag GULag, 1918-1956.  With this abridged paperback edition of The Gulag Archipelagos original three volumes-created with the cooperation of the author-you can introduce your students to a man and a book that helped to change the course of history.  An undisputed masterpiece of world literature, The Gulag Archipelago renders the four decades of terror and oppression into human terms. Drawing on his own experience before, during and after his eleven years of incarceration and exile, on evidence provided by more than 200 fellow prisoners, and on Soviet archives, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn reveals with torrential narrative and dramatic power the entire apparatus of Soviet repression, the state within the state that once ruled all-powerfully with its creation by Lenin in 1918.  Through specific portraits of its victimshis man, that woman, that childstudents will encounter the secret police operations, the labor camps and prisons, the uprooting or extermination of whole populations, the welcome that awaited Russian soldiers who had been German prisoners of war. They will also witness astounding moral courage, the incorruptibility with which the individual or a few scattered groups, all defenseless, endured brutality and degradation. It is Solzhenitsyns genius that transmutes this horrific indictment into a literary miracle. In the new introduction by Edward E. Ericson, Jr., the abridger, instructs students:  Given the nature of the Soviet experiment, the political dimension of life is never far from Solzhenitsyn's mind. But he always approaches politics in moral terms. Anyone, then, who views human reality primarily through the prism of politics will misread Gulag. . . .To read Gulag through a moral lens is to understand that government power can perpetrate all sorts of atrocities upon human beings, body and soul, but it can never fully succeed in quenching the human spirit.

37F15TLRCQX5,How Could This Happen : Explaining the Holocaust,"The Holocaust has long seemed incomprehensible, a monumental crime that beggars our powers of description and explanation. Historians have probed the many sources of this tragedy, but no account has united the various causes into an overarching synthesis that answers the vital question: How was such a nightmare possible in the heart of western civilization?  In  How Could This Happen, historian Dan McMillan distills the vast body of Holocaust research into a cogent explanation and comprehensive analysis of the genocide's many causes, revealing how a once-progressive society like Germany could have carried out this crime. The Holocaust, he explains, was caused not by one but by a combination of factors--from Germany's failure to become a democracy until 1918, to the widespread acceptance of anti-Semitism and scientific racism, to the effects of World War I, which intensified political divisions within the country and drastically lowered the value of human life in the minds of an entire generation. Masterfully synthesizing the myriad causes that led Germany to disaster, McMillan shows why thousands of Germans carried out the genocide while millions watched, with cold indifference, as it enveloped their homeland.  Persuasive and compelling,  How Could This Happen explains how a perfect storm of bleak circumstances, malevolent ideas, and damaged personalities unleashed history's most terrifying atrocity.

2Q7HJZ361O5N,Beautiful Jim Key (Paperback),"Masterfully told, poignant, and rich with spellbinding historical detail, this is the remarkable, true story of an extraordinary horse and his pioneering trainer who symbolized America at the dawn of the 20th century. 16-page photo insert.  Beautiful Jim Key -- the one-time ugly duckling of a scrub colt who became one of the most beloved heroes of the turn of the century -- was adored not for his beauty and speed but rather for his remarkable abilities to read, write, spell, do mathematics, even debate politics. Trained with patience and kindness by one of the most renowned horse whisperers of his day -- former slave, Civil War veteran, and self-taught veterinarian Dr. William Key -- Jim performed in expositions across the country to wildly receptive crowds for nine glorious years, smashing box office records, clearing towering hurdles of skepticism and prejudice, and earning the respect and admiration of some of the most influential figures of the era, from Booker T. Washington to President William McKinley. This is the remarkable true saga of a truly exceptional animal -- and the no less exceptional man who led him to greatness.--Bob Womack, author of The Echo of Hoof Beats: History of the Tennessee Walking Horse• Author: MIM E Rivas • ISBN:9780060567040 • Format:Paperback • Publication Date:2006-04-11",https://walmart.com/ip/2Q7HJZ361O5N,Books,/20th Century United States History Books,$19.99,4.3,3 ratings,"['49YD5E66R6XU', '4SAEE1GK0OUS', '5X5O88KFI5QE', '22ZF4IZ6K0UD', '70VHRBX3KXNP', '5804AQTV4K1J', '4IWPW5B1L6FM', '322NK6XCSVFS', '3TADYNKSTMX5', '324T0TEVWL05', '4E43EZ1VDTU1', '5BY57Z0GG3S0', '665G0YTR9R0J', '40VL2AXAPV5V', '7EA3KH223ROK', '4E43EZ1VDTU1', '3OG5H2YDXP1D', '5K0TMQUXSQXT', '35696VAFMELU', '3DGONY5E8EOY']"

1II8I6EZ7VG9,The Cigarette (Hardcover),"The untold political story of the most controversial consumer product in American history. Tobacco is the quintessential American product. From Jamestown to the Marlboro Man, the plant occupied the heart of the nation's economy and expressed its enduring myths. But today smoking rates have declined and smokers are exiled from many public spaces. The story of tobacco's fortunes may seem straightforward: science triumphed over our addictive habits and the cynical machinations of tobacco executives. Yet the reality is more complicated. Both the cigarette's popularity and its eventual decline reflect a parallel course of shifting political priorities. The tobacco industry flourished with the help of the state, but it was the concerted efforts of citizen nonsmokers who organized to fight for their right to clean air that led to its undoing. After the Great Depression, public officials and organized tobacco farmers worked together to ensure that the government's regulatory muscle was more often deployed to promote tobacco than to protect the public from its harms. Even as evidence of the cigarette's connection to cancer grew, medical experts could not convince officials to change their stance. What turned the tide, Sarah Milov argues, was a new kind of politics: a movement for nonsmokers' rights. Activists and public-interest lawyers took to the courts, the streets, city councils, and boardrooms to argue for smoke-free workplaces and allied with scientists to lobby elected officials. The Cigarette restores politics to its rightful place in the tale of tobacco's rise and fall, illustrating America's continuing battles over corporate influence, individual responsibility, collective choice, and the scope of governmental power.",https://walmart.com/ip/1II8I6EZ7VG9,Books,/Agribusiness Industry Books,$35.00,2.3,3 ratings,"['3O1RQ5J7I2LG', '4D5DMNZOE3AQ', '27B1Z3JVIAS2', '3P85NNO0HVR6', '4DII94ZIY485', '1R5NJXJJ3EDB', '60SG07IV7XQB', '3HQQXIARUIEE', '389K507B026X', '0YEEOSY6LHTP']"

4PSX4EVC2E1H,Views from the Reservation: A New Edition (Hardcover),"Photographer John Willis has long been aware of the exploitation that can occur when photographers enter communities as outsiders. So, in 1992, when he first visited the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, he assured elders of the Oglala Lakota nation that he would not exhibit any of his images. Over time, however, Willis earned the respect and trust of the community, and the elders urged him to show his work and create this book so that others might better understand Lakota land and life.  Willis has returned to the reservation every year since 1992, and he has come to grasp and interpret this place as few others have. Views from the Reservation, first published to widespread acclaim in 2010 and now presented in an updated and expanded edition, remains a gift--a wopila--that is meant to open the minds, eyes, and hearts of outsiders to the life, culture, and conditions of the Oglala Lakota people.  Along with his insightful and accomplished images, Willis has enlisted other voices to offer a more complete story: Lakota elders and high school students from the Pine Ridge Reservation offer powerful poems; writer Kent Nerburn contributes an original essay; Emil Her Many Horses, a curator at the National Museum of the American Indian, tells his story of growing up on the rez; Kevin Gover, Director of the National Museum of the American Indian, apologizes for the government's abuse of native people; Oglala Lakota artist Dwayne Wilcox shares his provocative ledger drawings; and members of the Reddest family present their amazing photo collection.   Views from the Reservation is a masterful book that has been praised by the Lakota people for its honesty, spirit, and depth. It offers the chance for native peoples and outsiders alike to appreciate and respect the Pine Ridge Reservation from contemporary and historical points of view, with art and storytelling leading the way.Photographer John Willis has long been aware of the exploitation that can occur when photographers enter communities as outsiders.

""After five decades of magisterial output, Doris Kearns Goodwin leads the league of presidential historians"" ( USA TODAY). In her ""inspiring"" ( The Christian Science Monitor)  Leadership, Doris Kearns Goodwin draws upon the four presidents she has studied most closely--Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Lyndon B. Johnson (in civil rights)--to show how they recognized leadership qualities within themselves and were recognized as leaders by others. By looking back to their first entries into public life, we encounter them at a time when their paths were filled with confusion, fear, and hope.   Leadership tells the story of how they all collided with dramatic reversals that disrupted their lives and threatened to shatter forever their ambitions. Nonetheless, they all emerged fitted to confront the contours and dilemmas of their times. At their best, all four were guided by a sense of moral purpose. At moments of great challenge, they were able to summon their talents to enlarge the opportunities and lives of others. Does the leader make the times or do the times make the leader?

1SKGK4CBX1P7,Unmasking Obama : The Fight to Tell the True Story of a Failed Presidency (Hardcover),"While the major media were spinning their collective fairy tale about the Obama presidency, the alternative conservative media--America's ""samizdat""--were telling the truth. During the Obama years, an asymmetrical media war was waged to control the critical first draft of American history. There is no fair way to record that history without first acknowledging the war. The field of battle shaped up as follows: on the right, the alternative conservative media and the ""responsible"" right, occasionally working together, often working at odds; on the left, the mainstream media, the social media giants, Hollywood, Broadway, the federal bureaucracies, the national security apparatus, and what Ray Bradbury would call ""firemen""--the virtual book burners, amateur and professional. Rarely at odds, these forces routinely worked together to amplify what Obama adviser Ben Rhodes famously called the White House's ""messaging campaign."" Money, resources, and power overwhelmingly favored the left, but the right had the equalizer on its side--the truth.• Author: Jack Cashill • ISBN:9781642934458 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-08-18",https://walmart.com/ip/1SKGK4CBX1P7,Books,/21st Century United States History Books,$28.00,0.0,0 ratings,"['1PBWG0VVOAE4', '6LXDDTKDRRWO', '3ORT84JFORMD', '57VZHPLHL3WI', '3196JMAPZ9OX', '74Z5XPQHQLR8', '4124VDRJ5J8X', '324T0TEVWL05', '30QRM4SOQ02C', '15289JMR215W', '324T0TEVWL05', '30QRM4SOQ02C', '15289JMR215W', '5804AQTV4K1J', '74Z5XPQHQLR8']"

0Z7SCN8UMPQP,Alaric the Goth : An Outsider's History of the Fall of Rome (Hardcover),"Denied citizenship by the Roman Empire, a soldier named Alaric changed history by unleashing a surprise attack on the capital city of an unjust empire.  Stigmatized and relegated to the margins of Roman society, the Goths were violent ""barbarians"" who destroyed ""civilization,"" at least in the conventional story of Rome's collapse. But a slight shift of perspective brings their history, and ours, shockingly alive. Alaric grew up near the river border that separated Gothic territory from Roman. He survived a border policy that separated migrant children from their parents, and he was denied benefits he likely expected from military service. Romans were deeply conflicted over who should enjoy the privileges of citizenship. They wanted to buttress their global power, but were insecure about Roman identity; they depended on foreign goods, but scoffed at and denied foreigners their own voices and humanity. In stark contrast to the rising bigotry, intolerance, and zealotry among Romans during Alaric's lifetime, the Goths, as practicing Christians, valued religious pluralism and tolerance. The marginalized Goths, marked by history as frightening harbingers of destruction and of the Dark Ages, preserved virtues of the ancient world that we take for granted. The three nights of riots Alaric and the Goths brought to the capital struck fear into the hearts of the powerful, but the riots were not without cause. Combining vivid storytelling and historical analysis, Douglas Boin reveals the Goths' complex and fascinating legacy in shaping our world.• Author: Douglas Boin • ISBN:9780393635690 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-06-09",https://walmart.com/ip/0Z7SCN8UMPQP,Books,/Ancient Roman History Books,$20.45,0.0,0 ratings,"['10B8R8CZJX18', '6GHYUBPEPJS5', '3AVPIVNOHPS8', '5SPO42D4D5YA', '50PYO9UY8RHG', '75UKWQDQ25LZ', '63G9HDB3PAIP', '35QSTF3MBHVL', '30VWREPJS09L', '2UUFBD2M1H5H', '2UUFBD2M1H5H', '35QSTF3MBHVL', '30VWREPJS09L', '4124VDRJ5J8X', '30QRM4SOQ02C']"

Ellis, Pulitzer Prize and National Book Award-winning author of Founding Brothers  Has God withdrawn his special blessing from the United States? Americans ponder that painful question in troubled times, as we did during the devastation of the Civil War and after the assassinations of the '60s, and as we do in our present polarization. Yet somehow--on battlefields, across western wilderness, and in raucous convention halls--astounding events have reliably advanced America, restoring faith in the Republic's providential protection.  In this provocative historical narrative, Michael Medved brings to life ten haunting tales that reveal this purposeful pattern, including:   - A near-fatal carriage accident forces Lincoln's secretary of state into a canvas-and-steel neck brace that protects him from a would-be assassin's knife thrusts, allowing him two years later to acquire Alaska for the United States.   - A sudden tidal wave of Russian Jewish immigration, be-ginning in 1881, coincides with America's rise to world leadership, fulfilling a biblical promise that those bless-ing Abraham's children will themselves be blessed.   - Campaigning for president, Theodore Roosevelt takes a bullet in the chest, but a folded speech in his jacket pocket slows its progress and saves his life.   - At the Battle of Midway, U.S. planes get lost over empty ocean and then miraculously reconnect for five minutes of dive-bombing that wrecks Japan's fleet, convincing even enemy commanders that higher powers intervened against them.   - A behind-the-scenes ""conspiracy of the pure of heart"" by Democratic leaders forces a gravely ill FDR to replace his sitting vice president--an unstable Stalinist--with future White House great Harry Truman.   These and other little-known stories build on themes of  The American Miracle, Medved's bestseller about America's remarkable rise. The confident heroes and stubborn misfits in these pages shared a common faith in a master plan, which continues to unfold in our time.  God's Hand on America con-firms that the founders were right about America's destiny to lead and enlighten the world.The national radio host and bestselling author of The American Miracle reveals the happy accidents, bizarre coincidences, and flat-out miracles that continue to shape America’s destiny.   “A hopeful message for our troubled times . . .

This is the first time that those in direct command of Delta Company have shared their memories of the most significant battle fought by Australians in Vietnam, the Battle of Long Tan. They describe the experiences that brought them to Vietnam, and how Company commander Harry Smith drove Delta Company to become one of the most outstanding units in the Australian forces. Each platoon played a crucial role in Delta Company's survival. The artillery's commitment in providing an unbroken wall of metal through which the enemy had to advance is told from the perspectives of both the forward controller and the gun positions. We fly with the RAAF helicopter pilots whose ammunition resupply was the turning point of the battle, and experience the carnage of the battlefield through the eyes of those in the relieving APCs. The trauma of the battle did not end with the action, however, as politics began to play its part in the drama. The valour of those directly involved in the battle was never duly recognised. The ongoing efforts of the Long Tan commanders to right the many wrongs perpetrated in the wake of the battle, and their own journeys from the events of August 1966 draw the reader into a compelling dialogue on the aftermath of Vietnam.

5DDGB66KUHYQ,The Quiet Americans : Four CIA Spies at the Dawn of the Cold War--A Tragedy in Three Acts (Hardcover),"A gripping account of four American spies at the dawn of the Cold War and the CIA's covert battles against communism, from the bestselling author of Lawrence in Arabia. ""ENTHRALLING...CAPTIVATING READING, especially in the hands of a storyteller as skilled as Anderson...the climate of fear and intolerance that it describes in Washington also feels uncomfortably timely. ""--Kevin Peraino, The New York Times Book Review  THE QUIET AMERICANS chronicles the exploits of the CIA's four original spies: Michael Burke, a charming former football star fallen on hard times, Frank Wisner, the scion of a wealthy Southern family, Peter Sichel, a sophisticated German Jew who escaped the Nazis, and Edward Lansdale, a brilliant ad executive. The four ran covert operations across the globe, trying to outwit the ruthless KGB in Berlin, parachuting commandos into Eastern Europe, plotting coups, and directing wars against Communist insurgents in Asia.  But time and again their efforts went awry, thwarted by a combination of incompetence and ideological rigidity at the highest levels of the government. The intertwined lives of these men began in a common purpose of defending freedom, but the ravages of the Cold War led them to different fates. Two would quit the CIA in despair, stricken by the moral compromises they had to make; one became the archetype of the duplicitous and destructive American spy; and one would be so heartbroken he would take his own life.  THE QUIET AMERICANS is the story of these four men. It is also the story of how the United States, at the very pinnacle of its power, managed to permanently damage its moral standing--a tragic outcome with consequences that echo around the world today.• Author: Scott Anderson • ISBN:9780385540452 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-09-01",https://walmart.com/ip/5DDGB66KUHYQ,Books,/Wars & Conflicts Military History Books,$22.27,0.0,0 ratings,"['6HXVNUN3P34W', '3ZL4WEM4EP9G', '2G7JHJIR53M0', '5UXWFAODO8Y0', '40OL1EX6VJRL', '4124VDRJ5J8X', '75UKWQDQ25LZ', '2E3BB2AI80SE', '30VWREPJS09L', '74Z5XPQHQLR8', '30VWREPJS09L', '2OY3TWT152Z7', '74Z5XPQHQLR8', '324T0TEVWL05', '29ISL0ZGTJR0']"
4QZV7KJQL4N5,Ordinary Men : Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland (Paperback),"In the early hours of July 13, 1942, the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101, a unit of the German Order Police, entered the Polish Village of Jozefow. They had arrived in Poland less than three weeks before, most of them recently drafted family men too old for combat service--workers, artisans, salesmen, and clerks. By nightfall, they had rounded up Jozefow's 1,800 Jews, selected several hundred men as ""work Jews,"" and shot the rest--that is, some 1,500 women, children, and old people. Most of these overage, rear-echelon reserve policemen had grown to maturity in the port city of Hamburg in pre-Hitler Germany and were neither committed Nazis nor racial fanatics. Nevertheless, in the sixteen months from the Jozefow massacre to the brutal Erntefest (""harvest festival"") slaughter of November 1943, these average men participated in the direct shooting deaths of at least 38,000 Jews and the deportation to Treblinka's gas chambers of 45,000 more--a total body count of 83,000 for a unit of less than 500 men. Drawing on postwar interrogations of 210 former members of the battalion, Christopher Browning lets them speak for themselves about their contribution to the Final Solution--what they did, what they thought, how they rationalized their behavior (one man would shoot only infants and children, to ""release"" them from their misery). In a sobering conclusion, Browning suggests that these good Germans were acting less out of deference to authority or fear of punishment than from motives as insidious as they are common: careerism and peer pressure. With its unflinching reconstruction of the battalion's murderous record and its painstaking attention to the social background and actions of individual men, this unique account offers some of the most powerful and disturbing evidence to date of the ordinary human capacity for extraordinary inhumanity.  In March 1942, approximately 75 to 80 percent of all victims of the Holocaust were still alive. Eleven months later, 75 to 80 percent were dead -- the result, according to Christopher R. Browning, of ""a short, intense wave of mass murder"" centered in Poland. One German unit of just over 450 men, Reserve Police Battalion 101, was responsible for the shooting of 39,000 Polish Jews and the deportation of 44,000 more to the Treblinka death camp over a period of 16 months.   In this chilling and stunningly powerful work, Browning describes how a group of average men became the cold-blooded murderers of tens of thousands of Jews. Drawing on a judicial interrogation of 210 members of the Battalion in the 1960's, he paints a portrait of the soldiers who took so many lives and comes to a disturbing conclusion about the universality of such barbarity in our world.   Christopher R. Browning is a professor of history at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington. He is a contributor to Yad Vashem's official twenty-four volume history of the Holocaust and the author of three books on the subject.

The untold story of the three intelligent and glamorous young women who accompanied their famous fathers to the Yalta Conference in February 1945, and of the conference's fateful reverberations in the waning days of World War II.  Tensions during the Yalta Conference in February 1945 threatened to tear apart the wartime alliance among Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin just as victory was close at hand. Catherine Grace Katz uncovers the dramatic story of the three young women who were chosen by their fathers to travel with them to Yalta, each bound by fierce family loyalty, political savvy, and intertwined romances that powerfully colored these crucial days.   Kathleen Harriman was a champion skier, war correspondent, and daughter of U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Averell Harriman. Sarah Churchill, an actress-turned-RAF officer, was devoted to her brilliant father, who depended on her astute political mind. Roosevelt's only daughter, Anna, chosen instead of her mother Eleanor to accompany the president to Yalta, arrived there as keeper of her father's most damaging secrets. Situated in the political maelstrom that marked the transition to a post- war world, The Daughters of Yalta is a remarkable story of fathers and daughters whose relationships were tested and strengthened by the history they witnessed and the future they crafted together.• Author: Catherine Grace Katz • ISBN:9780358117858 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-09-29",https://walmart.com/ip/6HJ99QNBE7LZ,Books,/Women's History Books,$21.11,0.0,0 ratings,"['40EF8K927V4N', '21912IFN0388', '1L1K9FMWQIWD', '61G17XL4V0VD', '58BUUP5NWZR4', '2E3BB2AI80SE', '2OY3TWT152Z7', '74Z5XPQHQLR8', '324T0TEVWL05', '35QSTF3MBHVL', '35QSTF3MBHVL', '324T0TEVWL05', '75UKWQDQ25LZ', '5804AQTV4K1J', '52S6DJ85ASMS']"
0UEJMTGMJX65,War and Peace (Hardcover),"The monumental Russian classic reflects the life and times of Russian society during the Napoleonic Wars. Tolstoy's epic masterpiece intertwines the lives of private and public individuals during the time of the Napoleonic wars and the French invasion of Russia. The fortunes of the Rostovs and the Bolkonskys, of Pierre, Natasha, and Andrei, are intimately connected with the national history that is played out in parallel with their lives. Balls and soirees alternate with councils of war and the machinations of statesmen and generals, scenes of violent battles with everyday human passions in a work whose extraordinary imaginative power has never been surpassed. The prodigious cast of characters, both great and small, seem to act and move as if connected by threads of destiny as the novel relentlessly questions ideas of free will, fate, and providence. Yet Tolstoy's portrayal of marital relations and scenes of domesticity is as truthful and poignant as the grand themes that underlie them.  In this definitive and highly acclaimed Maude translation, Tolstoy's genius and the power of his prose are made newly available to the contemporary reader. In addition this edition includes a new introduction by Amy Mandelker, revised and expanded notes, lists of fictional and historical characters, a chronology of historical events, five maps, and Tolstoy's essay 'Some Words about  War and Peace'. • Author: Leo Tolstoy,Amy Mandelker • ISBN:9780198800545 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2017-11-28",https://walmart.com/ip/0UEJMTGMJX65,Books,/Napoleonic Wars Military History Books,$19.24,4.2,142 ratings,"['2X9UC47ZIZ07', '1IRMESXR11MK', '141NP0OP7QCK', '2E0FR3UXVYVQ', '2JNQYOWTY840', '4XO9V0MRQ8VK', '5E6C4E34Y58M', '53B88BJ6D2M0', '2JNQYOWTY840', '27151ISDWCCO']"

6WK1PKFWGP5T,National Book Award Winner: The Yellow House (Paperback),"A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSLLER Winner of the 2019 National Book Award in Nonfiction  A brilliant, haunting and unforgettable memoir from a stunning new talent about the inexorable pull of home and family, set in a shotgun house in New Orleans East.  In 1961, Sarah M. Broom's mother Ivory Mae bought a shotgun house in the then-promising neighborhood of New Orleans East and built her world inside of it. It was the height of the Space Race and the neighborhood was home to a major NASA plant--the postwar optimism seemed assured. Widowed, Ivory Mae remarried Sarah's father Simon Broom; their combined family would eventually number twelve children. But after Simon died, six months after Sarah's birth, the Yellow House would become Ivory Mae's thirteenth and most unruly child. A book of great ambition, Sarah M. Broom's The Yellow House tells a hundred years of her family and their relationship to home in a neglected area of one of America's most mythologized cities. This is the story of a mother's struggle against a house's entropy, and that of a prodigal daughter who left home only to reckon with the pull that home exerts, even after the Yellow House was wiped off the map after Hurricane Katrina. The Yellow House expands the map of New Orleans to include the stories of its lesser known natives, guided deftly by one of its native daughters, to demonstrate how enduring drives of clan, pride, and familial love resist and defy erasure. Located in the gap between the ""Big Easy"" of tourist guides and the New Orleans in which Broom was raised, The Yellow House is a brilliant memoir of place, class, race, the seeping rot of inequality, and the internalized shame that often follows. It is a transformative, deeply moving story from an unparalleled new voice of startling clarity, authority, and power.National Book Award Winner: The Yellow House (Paperback)",https://walmart.com/ip/6WK1PKFWGP5T,Books,/Southern State & Local United States History Books,$14.59,0.0,0 ratings,"['3M2NYZXV6012', '1M5YQSWVBGK4', '46XDNZIY1P3S', '6EB1EDBHS0MH', '44U6VFGXU9PK', '29ISL0ZGTJR0', '63G9HDB3PAIP', '5GMCTEQUWGJ8', '3P85NNO0HVR6', '4ES0LS3OGFC1', '63G9HDB3PAIP', '29ISL0ZGTJR0', '14V7CY3U6ZVM', '580UEBTLUPZF', '4GO2I8X3ZZYH']"

4GPCNZ3XOGSI,How Baseball Happened : Outrageous Lies Exposed! the True Story Revealed (Hardcover),"The book tells how baseball happened, how it evolved with shocking speed from a casual folk game into a serious adult activity, an instrument of national unification and then a national entertainment industry.  The fascinating, true, story of baseball's origins. ""Explores the conditions and factors that begat the game in the 19th century and turned it into the national pastime....A delightful look at a young nation creating a pastime that was love from the first crack of the bat.""--Paul Dickson, The Wall Street Journal  Baseball's true founders don't have plaques in Cooperstown. The founders were the hundreds of uncredited amateurs -- ordinary people -- who played without gloves, facemasks or performance incentives in the middle decades of the 19th century. Unlike today's pro athletes, they lived full lives outside of sports. They worked, built businesses and fought against the South in the Civil War.  But that's not the way the story has been told. The wrongness of baseball history can be staggering. You may have heard that Abner Doubleday or Alexander Cartwright invented baseball. Neither did. You may have been told that a club called the Knickerbockers played the first baseball game in 1846. They didn't. You have read that baseball's color line was uncrossed and unchallenged until Jackie Robinson in 1947. Nope. You have been told that the clean, corporate 1869 Cincinnati Red Stockings were baseball's first professional club. Not true. They weren't the first professionals; they weren't all that clean, either. You may have heard Cooperstown, Hoboken, or New York City called the birthplace of baseball, but not Brooklyn. Yet Brooklyn was the home of baseball's first fans, the first ballpark, the first statistics--and modern pitching.  Baseball was originally supposed to be played, not watched. This changed when crowds began to show up at games in Brooklyn in the late 1850s. We fans weren't invited to the party; we crashed it. Professionalism wasn't part of the plan either, but when an 1858 Brooklyn versus New York City series accidentally proved that people would pay to see a game, the writing was on the outfield wall.  When the first professional league was formed in 1871, baseball was already a fully formed modern sport with championships, media coverage, and famous stars. Professional baseball invented an organization, but not the sport itself. Baseball's amazing amateurs had already done that.  Thomas W. Gilbert's history is for baseball fans and anyone fascinating by history, American culture, and how great things began. • Author: Thomas W Gilbert • ISBN:9781567926774 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-09-15",https://walmart.com/ip/4GPCNZ3XOGSI,Books,/Civil War United States History Books,$23.13,0.0,0 ratings,"['1YS4ZWZXPFI7', '3C24HYGK8FF8', '6ZYN2J4B6140', '7JBMP9DU0EA6', '4YBYXZIVNHBA', '4124VDRJ5J8X', '2E3BB2AI80SE', '74Z5XPQHQLR8', '324T0TEVWL05', '15289JMR215W', '324T0TEVWL05', '15289JMR215W', '5804AQTV4K1J', '52S6DJ85ASMS', '4124VDRJ5J8X']"

6QSZ61Y1BFC1,Journey Into the Land of the Zeks and Back: A Memoir of the Gulag (Hardcover),"Under the Soviet regime, millions of zeks (prisoners) were incarcerated in the forced labor camps, the Gulag. There many died of starvation, disease, and exhaustion, and some were killed by criminals and camp guards. In 1939, as the Nazis and Soviets invaded Poland, many Polish citizens found themselves swept up by the Soviet occupation and sent into the Gulag. One such victim was Julius Margolin, a Pinsk-born Jewish philosopher and writer living in Palestine who was in Poland on family matters.  Margolin's  Journey into the Land of the Zeks and Back offers a powerful, first-person account of one of the most shocking chapters of the violent twentieth century. Opening with the outbreak of World War II in Poland, Margolin relates its devastating impact on the Jews and his arrest and imprisonment in the Gulag system. During his incarceration from 1940 to 1945, he nearly died from starvation and overwork but was able to return to Western Europe and rejoin his family in Palestine. With a philosopher's astute analysis of man and society, as well as with humor, his memoir of flight, entrapment, and survival details the choices and dilemmas faced by an individual under extreme duress. Margolin's moving account illuminates universal issues of human rights under a totalitarian regime and ultimately the triumph of human dignity and decency.  This translation by Stefani Hoffman is the first English-language edition of this classic work, originally written in Russian in 1947 and published in an abridged French version in 1949. Circulated in a Russian samizdat version in the USSR, it exerted considerable influence on the formation of the genre of Gulag memoirs and was eagerly read by Soviet dissidents. Timothy Snyder's foreword and Katherine Jolluck's introduction contextualize the creation of this remarkable account of a Jewish world ravaged in the Stalinist empire--and the life of the man who was determined to reveal the horrors of the gulag camps and the plight of the zeks to the world.

He raises the important questions people must ask in order to survive.  #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER -  In Sapiens, he explored our past. In Homo Deus, he looked to our future. Now, one of the most innovative thinkers on the planet turns to the present to make sense of today's most pressing issues.  ""Fascinating . . . a crucial global conversation about how to take on the problems of the twenty-first century.""--Bill Gates, The New York Times Book Review  NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY FINANCIAL TIMES AND PAMELA PAUL, KQED   How do computers and robots change the meaning of being human? How do we deal with the epidemic of fake news? Are nations and religions still relevant? What should we teach our children?  Yuval Noah Harari's  21 Lessons for the 21st Century is a probing and visionary investigation into today's most urgent issues as we move into the uncharted territory of the future. As technology advances faster than our understanding of it, hacking becomes a tactic of war, and the world feels more polarized than ever, Harari addresses the challenge of navigating life in the face of constant and disorienting change and raises the important questions we need to ask ourselves in order to survive.   In twenty-one accessible chapters that are both provocative and profound, Harari builds on the ideas explored in his previous books, untangling political, technological, social, and existential issues and offering advice on how to prepare for a very different future from the world we now live in: How can we retain freedom of choice when Big Data is watching us? What will the future workforce look like, and how should we ready ourselves for it? How should we deal with the threat of terrorism? Why is liberal democracy in crisis?   Harari's unique ability to make sense of where we have come from and where we are going has captured the imaginations of millions of readers. Here he invites us to consider values, meaning, and personal engagement in a world full of noise and uncertainty. When we are deluged with irrelevant information, clarity is power. Presenting complex contemporary challenges clearly and accessibly,  21 Lessons for the 21st Century is essential reading.  ""If there were such a thing as a required instruction manual for politicians and thought leaders, Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari's 21 Lessons for the 21st Century would deserve serious consideration. In this collection of provocative essays, Harari . . . tackles a daunting array of issues, endeavoring to answer a persistent question: 'What is happening in the world today, and what is the deep meaning of these events?'""--BookPage (top pick)• Author: Yuval Noah Harari • ISBN:9780525512196 • Format:Paperback • Publication Date:2019-08-20",https://walmart.com/ip/69AMC0RQ85XG,Books,/Civilization History Books,$15.10,5.0,2 ratings,"['2ZX4C6XQXE11', '2WM8TRAHOASO', '2FLC5EC1JD79', '6JOLMKXMZ3OO', '3IQ0VT5JPQNK', '2UUFBD2M1H5H', '63G9HDB3PAIP', '30QRM4SOQ02C', '6U0DC1QOOAFD', '5MURM3IJWM4G', '30QRM4SOQ02C', '4PEU935A6IKH', '5DQSORTVBVM9', '2UUFBD2M1H5H', '25JFH3OV696T']"

Through centuries of bloody invasions and cruel oppression, their Lithuania was denied to them, yet here, in the anthracite coalfields of Pennsylvania, these immigrants worked to build communities of proud American citizens who continued to celebrate Kucios as well as Kaledos, eat blynai and saltibarscia, decorate marguciai, and pray the rosary in their native language. In Schuylkill County, they built the first churches, first schools, and first communities established by Lithuanians in the United States.

7LGTCRBXAMRP,Wilmington's Lie : The Murderous Coup of 1898 and the Rise of White Supremacy (Hardcover),"From Pulitzer Prize-winner David Zucchino comes a searing account of the Wilmington riot and coup of 1898, an extraordinary event unknown to most Americans From Pulitzer Prize-winner David Zucchino comes a searing account of the Wilmington riot and coup of 1898, an extraordinary event unknown to most Americans  By the 1890s, Wilmington was North Carolina's largest city and a shining example of a mixed-race community. It was a bustling port city with a burgeoning African American middle class and a Fusionist government of Republicans and Populists that included black aldermen, police officers and magistrates. There were successful black-owned businesses and an African American newspaper, The Record. But across the state--and the South--white supremacist Democrats were working to reverse the advances made by former slaves and their progeny.  In 1898, in response to a speech calling for white men to rise to the defense of Southern womanhood against the supposed threat of black predators, Alexander Manly, the outspoken young Record editor, wrote that some relationships between black men and white women were consensual. His editorial ignited outrage across the South, with calls to lynch Manly.  But North Carolina's white supremacist Democrats had a different strategy. They were plotting to take back the state legislature in November ""by the ballot or bullet or both,"" and then use the Manly editorial to trigger a ""race riot"" to overthrow Wilmington's multi-racial government. Led by prominent citizens including Josephus Daniels, publisher of the state's largest newspaper, and former Confederate Colonel Alfred Moore Waddell, white supremacists rolled out a carefully orchestrated campaign that included raucous rallies, race-baiting editorials and newspaper cartoons, and sensational, fabricated news stories.  With intimidation and violence, the Democrats suppressed the black vote and stuffed ballot boxes (or threw them out), to win control of the state legislature on November eighth. Two days later, more than 2,000 heavily armed Red Shirts swarmed through Wilmington, torching the Record office, terrorizing women and children, and shooting at least sixty black men dead in the streets. The rioters forced city officials to resign at gunpoint and replaced them with mob leaders. Prominent blacks--and sympathetic whites--were banished. Hundreds of terrified black families took refuge in surrounding swamps and forests.   This brutal insurrection is a rare instance of a violent overthrow of an elected government in the U.S. It halted gains made by blacks and restored racism as official government policy, cementing white rule for another half century. It was not a ""race riot,"" as the events of November 1898 came to be known, but rather a racially motivated rebellion launched by white supremacists.  In Wilmington's Lie, Pulitzer Prize-winner David Zucchino uses contemporary newspaper accounts, diaries, letters and official communications to create a gripping and compelling narrative that weaves together individual stories of hate and fear and brutality. This is a dramatic and definitive account of a remarkable but forgotten chapter of American history.(1) Additional Product Details - Product Type: Hard Cover Books // Binding: Hardcover // Subject: History - U.S. > United States - 19th Century > United States - State & Local - South (AL,AR,FL,GA,KY,LA,MS, > Anthropology - Cultural & Social // Size: 9.20 x 6.20 // Large Print: N // Contributors: Zucchino, David, , // EAN: 9780802128386 // ISBN: 0802128386 // Returnable: Y // Media Item: Y // Imprintable: // Indexable: // Publication Date: 2020-01-07 // Religious Item: N (2)",https://walmart.com/ip/7LGTCRBXAMRP,Books,/Cultural & Social Anthropology Books,$21.06,0.0,0 ratings,"['3FJQJJV39TW8', '1DLC9LKQR0DK', '4GNUBOIU5HV4', '1GC6CIHJVLZK', '3FNEWHH3J36A', '4J3Y5JVWCSLG', '27B1Z3JVIAS2', '6VL0ER0MVYSO', '7FUYL7I9AWE9', '68QYPPSCSSHZ', '4J3Y5JVWCSLG', '68QYPPSCSSHZ', '6VL0ER0MVYSO', '5JMI4MA7YFUT', '7FUYL7I9AWE9']"

""Craw's"" reputation for vice, violence, moral corruption, and unsanitary conditions made it a target for urban renewal projects that replaced the neighborhood with the city's Capital Plaza in the mid-1960s.  Douglas A. Boyd's Crawfish Bottom: Recovering a Lost Kentucky Community traces the evolution of the controversial community that ultimately saw four-hundred families displaced. Using oral histories and firsthand memories, Boyd not only provides a record of a vanished neighborhood and its culture but also demonstrates how this type of study enhances the historical record. A former Frankfort police officer describes Craw's residents as a ""rough class of people, who didn't mind killing or being killed."" In Crawfish Bottom, the former residents of Craw acknowledge the popular misconceptions about their community but offer a richer and more balanced view of the past.

0RMQRHIRMZQE,"Poison : The History of Potions, Powders and Murderous Practitioners (Hardcover)","Poison documents the tales of the users and victims of these mysterious substances. Profiles of the most commonly used toxins of each era reveal how poisoners have harnessed these natural killers to achieve their ends.  Poison documents the talkes of users and victims of these mysterious substances.Chronologically recounting the story of history's silent assassin, Poison documents the gripping tales of the users and victims of these mysterious substances. From Cleopatra, the Borgias and Qin Shi Huang to contemporary secret service agents and terrorists. Profiles of the most commonly used toxins of each era reveal how the power-hungry, the dangerous and the desperate have harnessed these natural killers to achieve their ends.  Poisoning is a dark art as old as human history itself. The Roman emperors used poison liberally to dispose of rivals, guests at Renaissance dinner parties were quietly assassinated with adulterated wine, and professional poisoners equipped murderous wives with toxic tonics for their husbands. In twentieth-century warfare, poisonous substances were used in new and awful ways to terrorize and obliterate both civilians and enemy forces. Today, in the search for the perfect covert weapon, shadowy figures deploy pernicious poisons which are almost impossible to trace. They are only the latest in a long line of experimenters: for the same poisons used to kill or injure others have been used throughout history as intoxicants, aphrodisiacs and even elixirs of life. As every amateur toxicologist knows, the difference between a poison and medicine is often simply the dose.• Author: Ben Hubbard • ISBN:9780233006116 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-09-01",https://walmart.com/ip/0RMQRHIRMZQE,Books,/Medical History Books,$21.06,0.0,0 ratings,"['6SGYN9MKC334', '3LFVTAJ3XQ4K', '6ELP99YG1TRC', '4W8YZ1HVNIIU', '33HWSSQM3G11', '6VL0ER0MVYSO', '27B1Z3JVIAS2', '68QYPPSCSSHZ', '4E43EZ1VDTU1', '6JPIN65VINMS', '4E43EZ1VDTU1', '1Q8LMB0PM1I3', '0SXTXBQFISHI', '6ODLOLRIDQEF', '3A22DUPSSKBY']"
2IDOIR59YTAG,The Red Prince : The Secret Lives of a Habsburg Archduke,"In this exhilarating narrative, prize-winning historian Snyder offers an indelible portrait of Wilhelm von Habsburg whose life personifies the wrenching upheavals of the first half of the 20th century, as the rule of empire gave way to the new politics of nationalism. 20 b&w photos and maps.Wilhelm Von Habsburg wore the uniform of the Austrian officer, the court regalia of a Habsburg archduke, the simple suit of a Parisian exile, the collar of the Order of the Golden Fleece, and, every so often, a dress. He could handle a saber, a pistol, a rudder, or a golf club; he handled women by necessity and men for pleasure. He spoke the Italian of his archduchess mother, the German of his archduke father, the English of his British royal friends, the Polish of the country his father wished to rule, and the Ukrainian of the land Wilhelm wished to rule himself. In this exhilarating narrative history, prize-winning historian Timothy D. Snyder offers an indelible portrait of an aristocrat whose life personifies the wrenching upheavals of the first half of the twentieth century, as the rule of empire gave way to the new politics of nationalism. Coming of age during the First World War, Wilhelm repudiated his family to fight alongside Ukrainian peasants in hopes that he would become their king. When this dream collapsed he became, by turns, an ally of German imperialists, a notorious French lover, an angry Austrian monarchist, a calm opponent of Hitler, and a British spy against Stalin. Played out in Europe's glittering capitals and bloody battlefields, in extravagant ski resorts and dank prison cells,  The Red Prince captures an extraordinary moment in the history of Europe, in which the old order of the past was giving way to an undefined future-and in which everything, including identity itself, seemed up for grabs.",https://walmart.com/ip/2IDOIR59YTAG,Books,/Austria & Hungary History Books,$29.81,4.0,2 ratings,"['30QRM4SOQ02C', '63G9HDB3PAIP', '6U0DC1QOOAFD', '3P85NNO0HVR6', '4E43EZ1VDTU1', '30QRM4SOQ02C', '63G9HDB3PAIP', '6U0DC1QOOAFD', '50ZD0V0OVRQE', '536PVAGRP3O4']"

In the spring of 2017, Adam Shoalts, bestselling author and adventurer, set off on an unprecedented solo journey across North America's greatest wilderness. A place where, in our increasingly interconnected, digital world, it's still possible to wander for months without crossing a single road, or even see another human being.  Between his starting point in Eagle Plains, Yukon Territory, to his destination in Baker Lake, Nunavut, lies a maze of obstacles: shifting ice floes, swollen rivers, fog-bound lakes, and gale-force storms. And Shoalts must time his departure by the breakup of the spring ice, then sprint across nearly 4,000 kilometers of rugged, wild terrain to arrive before winter closes in.  He travels alone up raging rivers that only the most expert white-water canoeists dare travel even downstream. He must portage across fields of jagged rocks that stretch to the horizon, and navigate labyrinths of swamps, tormented by clouds of mosquitoes every step of the way. And the race against the calendar means that he cannot afford the luxuries of rest, or of making mistakes. Shoalts must trek tirelessly, well into the endless Arctic summer nights, at times not even pausing to eat.  But his reward is the adventure of a lifetime.  Heart-stopping, wonder-filled, and attentive to the majesty of the natural world,  Beyond the Trees captures the ache for adventure that afflicts us all.National bestsellerA thrilling odyssey through an unforgiving landscape, from ""Canada's greatest living explorer.""

1R312EAKSZY2,American Meth : A History of the Methamphetamine Epidemic in America (Paperback),"Methamphetamine: the quintessential American drug. American housewives, heads of state, businessmen and poets alike have acquired a taste for the yellow, crystalline powder. Everyone from Hitler to President Kennedy to Elvis to Jack Kerouac indulged in one of its many forms, and its presence has been an invisible hand shaping events, preparing the ground for the strangest drug epidemic the world has ever seen. Today methamphetamine is everywhere, and there seems to be no way of stemming its growth.   It is the backbone of Ritalin and the 'club drugs"" Ecstasy, Eve and Cat. According to the DEA statistics, approximately four percent of all Americans have used clandestinely manufactured methamphetamine. In the 1960s and 1970s millions of mainstream Americans used and abused prescription amphetamines; today, anyone with a stovetop, a beaker, and a little know-how can make its derivative, methamphetamine, with chemicals purchased at the hardware store and pharmacy down the street.  American Meth is the unprecedented story of a molecule in all of its incarnations, and the deep but little-known impact it has had on American life over the course of the last century. Told from the viewpoint of author Sterling Braswell, whose life has been touched by the drug, American Meth is a deeply personal drama that illuminates the epidemic we live with today.American Meth: A History of the Methamphetamine Epidemic in America (Paperback)",https://walmart.com/ip/1R312EAKSZY2,Books,/Drugs Substance Abuse & Addictions Self-Help Books,$18.78,0.0,0 ratings,"['707KVWYWFELF', '6JJX8ACD8IFC', '0XMAB22BLJTL', '438ADRFD6OGN', '2RM88VRB4J9D', '3IRP8YIFJ1L4', '2UUFBD2M1H5H', '3SFPMX7UK6IF', '63G9HDB3PAIP', '3Y5D7OM6KWLU', '3IRP8YIFJ1L4', '1JUKK9EWDNZA', '3Y5D7OM6KWLU', '63G9HDB3PAIP', '5W63N7L4UR7Q']"

Varied industries thrived through World War II, and downtown bustled with shoppers visiting department stores like Petersen's.

When America declared war on Spain in 1898, the US Army had just 26,000 men, spread around the country--hardly an army at all. In desperation, the Rough Riders were born. A unique group of volunteers, ranging from Ivy League athletes to Arizona cowboys and led by Theodore Roosevelt, they helped secure victory in Cuba in a series of gripping, bloody fights across the island. Roosevelt called their charge in the Battle of San Juan Hill his ""crowded hour""--a turning point in his life, one that led directly to the White House. ""The instant I received the order,"" wrote Roosevelt, ""I sprang on my horse and then my 'crowded hour' began."" As  The Crowded Hour reveals, it was a turning point for America as well, uniting the country and ushering in a new era of global power. ""A revelatory history of America's grasp for power"" ( Kirkus Reviews, starred review).  Both a portrait of these men, few of whom were traditional soldiers, and of the Spanish-American War itself,  The Crowded Hour dives deep into the daily lives and struggles of Roosevelt and his regiment. Using diaries, letters, and memoirs, Risen illuminates an influential moment in American history: a war of only six months' time that dramatically altered the United States' standing in the world.

24WYP1NJA90I,South Philadelphia's Little Italy and 9th Street Italian Market (Paperback),"When the first Italian moved to the area near Catherine Street around 1798, it was mostly forest and field. It was considered Irishtown by the early residents. By 1852, an Italian church had been established for the community, and from the advent of mass migration beginning in 1876 grew Philadelphia's Little Italy. The original neighborhood was bound by the area from Sixth Street to Eleventh Street and Bainbridge to Federal Streets. Many of the early families--Baldi, Pinto, and Fiorella--established businesses in the area that continue today. Other beautiful buildings still left standing are remnants of the once thriving banking industry in this little neighborhood. As time progressed, the market expanded beyond its local neighbors. Italians throughout Philadelphia developed their own Little Italy communities to the north, west, and farther south of the original boundaries.",https://walmart.com/ip/24WYP1NJA90I,Books,/General Ethnic Studies Books,$17.58,0.0,0 ratings,"['6W6Z9RQQ7N1I', '2A5ASUED6P8S', '1YTUBC64W66S', '3SKQCLK717XJ', '6J09S971KYN4', '2P2DZ2FC4O4Z', '4PGVO73E29J2', '4NZUXPGRGRFD', '3T2ROCI39J6F', '7BF9I465OUKJ', '4GO2I8X3ZZYH', '0RT2JWQAUNTH', '5D8G3M4XQ7ET', '4IUV42QFLLYP', '7BF9I465OUKJ']"

46DAW7DJQP2E,Cherokee Bill : Black Cowboy-Indian Outlaw (Paperback),"Once upon a time in the late 19th century, there was an outlaw that captured the imagination of the American public like no other. He can be compared to John Dillinger or Pretty Boy Floyd of the 1930s. Like both of these men, he garnered national press for his exploits. This outlaw's name was Crawford Goldsby, better known as Cherokee Bill.  Once upon a time in the late nineteenth century, there was an outlaw that captured the imagination of the American public like no other. He can be compared to John Dillinger or Pretty Boy Floyd of the 1930s. Like both of these men, he garnered national press for his exploits; the well-known New York Times had a running commentary on his actions and deeds. This outlaw's name was Crawford Goldsby, better known as Cherokee Bill.  Cherokee Bill was every bit as colorful and outrageous as any criminal of the western frontier, perhaps even more so. There were a few things about him that made him truly unique for a famous desperado of the purple sage. First and foremost, he was an African American living in the Indian Territory. He was also Native American, Bill was a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, as a freedman, from his mother's lineage.  Compare Cherokee Bill to Billy the Kid, (Billy Antrim), of New Mexico Territory fame. Although both outlaws received national media attention for their crimes while they were living, Billy the Kid was remembered and immortalized in books and films in the twentieth century; this did not occur for Cherokee Bill.

2RBM9PR4FFNQ,Hiroshima (Spanish Edition),"La crónica sobre seis supervivientes de Hiroshima que se convirtió en un gran clásico del periodismo.  Toda persona que sepa leer, debería leer este libro.»Saturday Review of Literature.   El verano de 1945, William Shawn, director ejecutivo de The New Yorker, habló con el reportero John Hersey sobre la idea de publicar un relato que ilustrara la dimensión humana de los efectos de la bomba atómica en Hiroshima, pues le causaba estupor comprobar que, pese a la gran cantidad de información sobre la bomba que recibían, se estaba ignorando lo que realmente había ocurrido en Hiroshima.  El reportero aceptó el encargo. Hershey viajó a Hiroshima para investigar y entrevistar a varios supervivientes de la explosión de la bomba atómica, lanzada el 6 de agosto de 1945, y decidió que el retrato lo conformarían seis testimonios: una oficinista, Toshiko Sasaki; un médico, el Dr. Masakazu Fuji; una viuda a cargo de sus tres hijos pequeños, Hatsuyo Nakamura; un misionero alemán, el padre Wilhem Kleinsorge; un joven cirujano, el Dr. Terufumi Sasaki y un pastor metodista, el reverendo Kiyoshi Tanimoto.   La publicación de Hiroshima trajo consigo una enorme conmoción.  El reportaje se publicó en una edición monotemática de The New Yorker el 31 de agosto de 1946. La revista se agotó inmediatamente y de todo el mundo llegó una avalancha de peticiones de reimpresión.  Su difusión corrió como la pólvora y en pocos meses la editorial Alfred A. Knopf lo publicó como libro, permitiendo que al año siguiente ya se hubiera traducido y publicado prácticamente en todo el mundo.   En la actualidad Hiroshima lleva vendidos más de un millón de ejemplares y es un referente del periodismo de investigación y un clásico de la literatura de guerra.  Es el único artículo, entre los millares de textos escritos sobre la bomba atómica, que describe cómo era la vida para las personas que habían sobrevivido a un ataque nuclear.  Y está considerado como «el más famoso artículo de revista jamás publicado».   ENGLISH DESCRIPTION   ""The accounts of six Hiroshima survivors that became a great journalism classic.

1HW85FKKZE2L,The Five : The Untold Lives of the Women Killed by Jack the Ripper,"  Miscast in the media for nearly 130 years, the victims of Jack the Ripper finally get their full stories told in this eye-opening and chilling reminder that life for middle-class women in Victorian London could be full of social pitfalls and peril.  Five devastating human stories and a dark and moving portrait of Victorian London—the untold lives of the women killed by Jack the Ripper   Polly, Annie, Elisabeth, Catherine, and Mary Jane are famous for the same thing, though they never met. They came from Fleet Street, Knightsbridge, Wolverhampton, Sweden, and Wales. They wrote ballads, ran coffeehouses, lived on country estates; they breathed ink dust from printing presses and escaped human traffickers.    What they had in common was the year of their murders: 1888. The person responsible was never identified, but the character created by the press to fill that gap has become far more famous than any of these five women.    For more than a century, newspapers have been keen to tell us that “the Ripper” preyed on prostitutes. Not only is this untrue, as historian Hallie Rubenhold has discovered, but it has prevented the real stories of these fascinating women from being told. Now, in this devastating narrative of five lives, Rubenhold finally sets the record straight, revealing a world not just of Dickens and Queen Victoria, but of poverty, homelessness, and rampant misogyny. They died because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time—but their greatest misfortune was to be born women.     ",https://walmart.com/ip/1HW85FKKZE2L,Books,/Social History Books,$16.86,0.0,0 ratings,"['33VZTF3S9PF8', '7DH3N6BB48IO', '4PEU935A6IKH', '6BHAGLLWDPAF', '7AP3S1DNKW3N', '1UR6CB3XVXJS', '30VWREPJS09L', '79HFYEX6KH5S', '4J3Y5JVWCSLG', '7JWIR99ZL8HW', '3QGE6X2OAURD', '581AOY2WAKUV', '3GWAYW3IIH7R', '510XZ0SMRJOO', '68XBWMFVXR36']"
6PKOTDOFTPFP,Little Book of Fashion: Little Book of Gucci: The Story of the Iconic Fashion House (Hardcover),"One of the oldest Italian fashion brands in existence today, Gucci was founded in Florence in 1921. Guccio Gucci established his company with the goal of creating opulent luggage for Italy's wealthy and fashionable upper-classes. With the signature Gucci print of dark brown diamonds on a tan background, interlocking G logo and red and green stripe, the brand has gone on to become the last word in Italian luxury. Gucci's signature items - the belt, the bag, the loafer - transcend fleeting fashion trends, and have remained central to the house's identity into the twenty-first century. Under the stewardship of Tom Ford, Gucci epitomized the louche and mischievous 1990s aesthetic. Today, under Alessandro Michele, the brand's combination of romance and toughness is in hot demand.

On this small barrier island descendants of the first generations of Gullah people continue to preserve Gullah language, customs, arts, and cuisine. The three authors of  Gullah Days: Hilton Head Islanders Before the Bridge 1861-1956 are among those descendants, and in this book, they chronicle the amazing history of their secluded community from the Civil War through the 1950s, when real estate development connected Hilton Head Island to the mainland with a bridge.  The history of these Gullah islanders, little celebrated until now, is an amazing American story. Hilton Head Island was one of the first areas liberated by Union troops after Fort Sumter. With plantation owners absent, the society of formerly enslaved Gullah people embarked on the activities of freedom: enlisting in fighting for the Union army; creating the first black-governed community in the South, complete with a police force; and, when formal emancipation arrived, running for office, campaigning, and voting.  This book illustrates in vivid detail the story of that vibrant post-Civil War era and the tangled perils of Reconstruction that followed, along with all of the progress and setbacks of African Americans in the South over 150 years via the lives of Gullah Hilton Head Islanders. Authors rely on the historical records and amazing first-person accounts they have gathered from their relatives and other community members to tell this riveting story.The Gullah culture, though borne of isolation and slavery, thrived on the US East Coast sea islands from pre-Civil War times until today, and nowhere more prominently than on Hilton Head Island, SC.

It killed more people in twenty-four months than AIDS killed in twenty-four years, more in a year than the Black Death killed in a century. But this was not the Middle Ages, and 1918 marked the first collision of science and epidemic disease. Revised to reflect the growing danger of the avian flu, this is ultimately a tale of triumph amid tragedy, providing us with a precise and sobering model as we confront the epidemics looming on our own horizon.""--  #1 New York Times bestseller ""Barry will teach you almost everything you need to know about one of the deadliest outbreaks in human history.""--Bill Gates, GatesNotes.com Monumental... an authoritative and disturbing morality tale.--Chicago Tribune    The strongest weapon against pandemic is the truth. Read why in the definitive account of the 1918 Flu Epidemic.   Magisterial in its breadth of perspective and depth of research,  The Great Influenza provides us with a precise and sobering model as we confront the epidemics looming on our own horizon. As Barry concludes, The final lesson of 1918, a simple one yet one most difficult to execute, is that...those in authority must retain the public's trust. The way to do that is to distort nothing, to put the best face on nothing, to try to manipulate no one. Lincoln said that first, and best. A leader must make whatever horror exists concrete. Only then will people be able to break it apart.  At the height of World War I, history's most lethal influenza virus erupted in an army camp in Kansas, moved east with American troops, then exploded, killing as many as 100 million people worldwide.

2UPX5QUON4CH,"If These Stones Could Talk: African American Presence in the Hopewell Valley, Sourland Mountain and Surrounding Regions of New Jersey (Paperback)","Cemeteries have stories to tell, voices to unearth--and lessons from the past that we can draw upon to better shape the future. If These Stones Could Talk brings fresh light to a forgotten corner of American history that begins in a small cemetery in central New Jersey. Authors of If These Stones Could Talk Elaine Buck and Beverly Mills started their journey through the past as two middle aged African American women with busy but quiet lives. They were both board members of the Stoutsburg Cemetery Association, a cemetery that is nestled in New Jersey's Sourland Mountain region. The cemetery was purchased by three Black men in the early 19th century to bury Blacks with honor and dignity. When Buck and Mills got an unexpected call for help, what began as a search through the woods for gravestone markers soon had them rummaging through land deeds and making relentless calls to state officials, archeologists and reporters. Their foray into historic preservation work convinced Buck and Mills that they had a lot more work left to do to connect African American history to local and national history books--within which they still felt largely absent from the most visible narratives in United States history. In warm but unflinching voices authors Buck and Mills offer readers a unique window into our past.

7479N2KEWXHI,The Flying Tigers : The Untold Story of the American Pilots Who Waged a Secret War Against Japan,"Flying Tigers...The thrilling story behind the American pilots who were secretly recruited to defend the nation’s desperate Chinese allies before Pearl Harbor and ended up on the front lines of the war against the Japanese in the Pacific.    Sam Kleiner’s  The  Flying Tigers uncovers the hidden story of the group of young American men and women who crossed the Pacific before Pearl Harbor to risk their lives defending China. Led by legendary army pilot Claire Chennault, these men left behind an America still at peace in the summer of 1941 using false identities to travel across the Pacific to a run-down airbase in the jungles of Burma. In the wake of the disaster at Pearl Harbor this motley crew was the first group of Americans to take on the Japanese in combat, shooting down hundreds of Japanese aircraft in the skies over Burma, Thailand, and China. At a time when the Allies were being defeated across the globe, the Flying Tigers’ exploits gave hope to Americans and Chinese alike.     Kleiner takes readers into the cockpits of their iconic shark-nosed P-40 planes—one of the most familiar images of the war—as the Tigers perform nail-biting missions against the Japanese. He profiles the outsize personalities involved in the operation, including Chennault, whose aggressive tactics went against the prevailing wisdom of military strategy; Greg “Pappy” Boyington, the man who would become the nation’s most beloved pilot until he was shot down and became a POW; Emma Foster, one of the nurses in the unit who had a passionate romance with a pilot named John Petach; and Madame Chiang Kai-shek herself, who first brought Chennault to China and who would come to visit these young Americans.   A dramatic story of a covert operation whose very existence would have scandalized an isolationist United States,  The  Flying Tigers is the unforgettable account of a group of Americans whose heroism changed the world, and who cemented an alliance between the United States and China as both nations fought against seemingly insurmountable odds.",https://walmart.com/ip/7479N2KEWXHI,Books,/World War II Military History Books,$14.54,0.0,0 ratings,"['2NSZ5UO25WQH', '37MAQ6Z9EB9S', '12OBTOTS6W81', '75UUL13J2DUW', '2ZEDKJTAIFDJ', '3T2ROCI39J6F', '74NPLH2589HI', '0RT2JWQAUNTH', '3C2E2XJ2I4R6', '2BFQLQ37LMCX', '510XZ0SMRJOO', '6D1UULHOZ614', '4RJELG0HA5C8', '580UEBTLUPZF', '7BF9I465OUKJ']"

2EON2BH774WY,Women of Power in Anglo-Saxon England (Hardcover),"Many Anglo-Saxon kings are familiar. Æthelred the Unready is one, yet less is written of his wife, who was consort of two kings and championed one of her sons over the others, or his mother who was an anointed queen and powerful regent, but was also accused of witchcraft and regicide. Many Anglo-Saxon kings are familiar. Æthelred the Unready is one, yet less is written of his wife, who was consort of two kings and championed one of her sons over the others, or his mother who was an anointed queen and powerful regent, but was also accused of witchcraft and regicide. A royal abbess educated five bishops and was instrumental in deciding the date of Easter; another took on the might of Canterbury and Rome and was accused by the monks of fratricide.  Anglo-Saxon women were prized for their bloodlines - one had such rich blood that it sparked a war - and one was appointed regent of a foreign country. Royal mothers wielded power; Eadgifu, wife of Edward the Elder, maintained a position of authority during the reigns of both her sons.  Æthelflaed, Lady of the Mercians, was a queen in all but name, while few have heard of Queen Seaxburh, who ruled Wessex, or Queen Cynethryth, who issued her own coinage. She, too, was accused of murder, but was also, like many of the royal women, literate and highly-educated.  From seventh-century Northumbria to eleventh-century Wessex and making extensive use of primary sources,  Women of Power in Anglo-Saxon England examines the lives of individual women in a way that has often been done for the Anglo-Saxon men but not for their wives, sisters, mothers and daughters. It tells their stories: those who ruled and schemed, the peace-weavers and the warrior women, the saints and the sinners. It explores, and restores, their reputations.• Author: Annie Whitehead • ISBN:9781526748119 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-09-16",https://walmart.com/ip/2EON2BH774WY,Books,/Women's History Books,$24.32,0.0,0 ratings,"['40EF8K927V4N', '21912IFN0388', '140G3WONW5VQ', '1L1K9FMWQIWD', '3MI5TZM0W30L', '25JFH3OV696T', '2CQ3MYYBL6AR', '1UR6CB3XVXJS', '4124VDRJ5J8X', '52S6DJ85ASMS', '2CQ3MYYBL6AR', '25JFH3OV696T', '1UR6CB3XVXJS', '4124VDRJ5J8X', '15289JMR215W']"

During World War II, Géraldine Schwarz's German grandparents were neither heroes nor villains; they were merely Mitlaüfer those who followed the current. Once the war ended, they wanted to bury the past under the wreckage of the Third Reich.  Decades later, while delving through filing cabinets in the basement of their apartment building in Mannheim, Schwarz discovers that in 1938, her paternal grandfather Karl took advantage of Nazi policies to buy a business from a Jewish family for a low price. She finds letters from the only survivor of this family (all the others perished in Auschwitz), demanding reparations. But Karl Schwarz refused to acknowledge his responsibility. Géraldine starts to question the past: How guilty were her grandparents? What makes us complicit? On her mother's side, she investigates the role of her French grandfather, a policeman in Vichy.  Weaving together the threads of three generations of her family story with Europe's process of post-war reckoning, Schwarz explores how millions were seduced by ideology, overcome by a fog of denial after the war, and, in Germany at least, eventually managed to transform collective guilt into democratic responsibility. She asks: How can nations learn from history? And she observes that countries that avoid confronting the past are especially vulnerable to extremism.

4D3WSE9NXTGK,Three Days: Three Days in Moscow: Ronald Reagan and the Fall of the Soviet Empire (Paperback),"An instant classic, if not the finest book to date on Ronald Reagan."" -- Jay Winik President Reagan's dramatic battle to win the Cold War is revealed as never before by the #1 bestselling author and award-winning anchor of the #1 rated Special Report with Bret Baier. Moscow, 1988: 1,000 miles behind the Iron Curtain, Ronald Reagan stood for freedom and confronted the Soviet empire.  In his acclaimed bestseller Three Days in January, Bret Baier illuminated the extraordinary leadership of President Dwight Eisenhower at the dawn of the Cold War. Now in his highly anticipated new history, Three Days in Moscow, Baier explores the dramatic endgame of America's long struggle with the Soviet Union and President Ronald Reagan's central role in shaping the world we live in today. On May 31, 1988, Reagan stood on Russian soil and addressed a packed audience at Moscow State University, delivering a remarkable--yet now largely forgotten--speech that capped his first visit to the Soviet capital. This fourth in a series of summits between Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, was a dramatic coda to their tireless efforts to reduce the nuclear threat. More than that, Reagan viewed it as ""a grand historical moment"" an opportunity to light a path for the Soviet people--toward freedom, human rights, and a future he told them they could embrace if they chose. It was the first time an American president had given an address about human rights on Russian soil. Reagan had once called the Soviet Union an ""evil empire."" Now, saying that depiction was from ""another time,"" he beckoned the Soviets to join him in a new vision of the future. The importance of Reagan's Moscow speech was largely overlooked at the time, but the new world he spoke of was fast approaching; the following year, in November 1989, the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union began to disintegrate, leaving the United States the sole superpower on the world stage. Today, the end of the Cold War is perhaps the defining historical moment of the past half century, and must be understood if we are to make sense of America's current place in the world, amid the re-emergence of US-Russian tensions during Vladimir Putin's tenure. Using Reagan's three days in Moscow to tell the larger story of the president's critical and often misunderstood role in orchestrating a successful, peaceful ending to the Cold War, Baier illuminates the character of one of our nation's most venerated leaders--and reveals the unique qualities that allowed him to succeed in forming an alliance for peace with the Soviet Union, when his predecessors had fallen short.--JAY WINIK, author of  1944 and  April 1865Three Days: Three Days in Moscow: Ronald Reagan and the Fall of the Soviet Empire (Paperback)",https://walmart.com/ip/4D3WSE9NXTGK,Books,/Presidents & Heads of State Biographies & Memoirs,$13.07,5.0,2 ratings,"['7B3AOIO8AW89', '4E43EZ1VDTU1', '5I6N2PCL9OV4', '6PSXHKB3ZQG7', '4ZMD1X0X61TU', '4E43EZ1VDTU1', '3OG5H2YDXP1D', '35696VAFMELU', '5K0TMQUXSQXT', '3P85NNO0HVR6', '4E43EZ1VDTU1', '3OG5H2YDXP1D', '35696VAFMELU', '5K0TMQUXSQXT', '3P85NNO0HVR6']"

The movie Jeremiah Johnson introduced millions to the legendary mountain man, John Johnson. The real Johnson was a far cry from the Redford version. Standing 6'2"" in his stocking feet and weighing nearly 250 pounds, he was a mountain man among mountain men, one of the toughest customers on the western frontier. As the story goes, one morning in 1847 Johnson returned to his Rocky Mountain trapper's cabin to find the remains of his murdered Indian wife and her unborn child. He vowed vengeance against an entire Indian tribe. Crow Killer tells of that one-man, decades-long war to avenge his beloved. Whether seen as a realistic glimpse of a long ago, fierce frontier world, or as a mythic retelling of the many tales spun around and by Johnson, Crow Killer is unforgettable.

1CQXFZHDIUNH,The Union Assaults at Vicksburg (Hardcover),"It was the third week of May 1863, and after seven months and six attempts, Ulysses S. Grant was finally at the doorstep of Vicksburg. What followed was a series of attacks and maneuvers against the last major section of the Mississippi River controlled by the Confederacy--and one of the most important operations of the Civil War. Grant intended to end the campaign quickly by assault, but the stalwart defense of Vicksburg's garrison changed his plans. The Union Assaults at Vicksburg is the first comprehensive account of this quick attempt to capture Vicksburg, which proved critical to the Union's ultimate success and Grant's eventual solidification as one of the most significant military commanders in American history.  Establishing a day-to-day--;and occasionally minute-to-minute--;timeline for this crucial week, military historian Timothy B. Smith invites readers to follow the Vicksburg assaults as they unfold. His finely detailed account reaches from the offices of statesmen and politicians to the field of battle, with exacting analysis and insight that ranges from the highest level of planning and command to the combat experience of the common soldier. As closely observed and vividly described as each assault is, Smith's book also puts the sum of these battles into the larger context of the Vicksburg campaign, as well as the entire war. His deeply informed, in-depth work thus provides the first full view of a key but little-studied turning point in the fortunes of the Union army in the West, Ulysses S. Grant, and the United States of America.• Author: Timothy B Smith • ISBN:9780700629060 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-01-10",https://walmart.com/ip/1CQXFZHDIUNH,Books,/United States Military History Books,$34.95,0.0,0 ratings,"['1IPH5GBYGQ0L', '3DAUZVJAGOQC', '2EH3AAKEAJG9', '5QF0I9XB9M12', '2XDG7YYOEIZL', '4124VDRJ5J8X', '2CQ3MYYBL6AR', '25JFH3OV696T', '52S6DJ85ASMS', '15289JMR215W', '4124VDRJ5J8X', '2CQ3MYYBL6AR', '25JFH3OV696T', '52S6DJ85ASMS', '15289JMR215W']"
7AU0Z1Y296G8,To Start a War : How the Bush Administration Took America Into Iraq (Hardcover),"""Even now, after more than fifteen years, it is hard to see the invasion of Iraq through the cool, considered gaze of history. For too many people, the damage is still too palpable, and still unfolding. Most of the major players in that decision are still with us, and few are not haunted by it, in one way or another. Perhaps that combination, the passage of the years and the still unresolved trauma, explains why so many protagonists opened up so fully for the first time to Robert Draper. Draper's prodigious reporting has yielded scores of important new revelations, from the important to the merely absurd. As a whole, the book paints a vivid and indelible picture of a decision-making process that was fatally compromised, by a combination of post-9/11 fear and paranoia, rank naèivetâe, craven groupthink, and a set of actors with idâees fixes who gamed the process relentlessly. Everything was believed; nothing was true. The intelligence failure was comprehensive. Draper's fair-mindedness and deep understanding of the principal actors suffuse his account, as does a storytelling genius that is close to sorcery. No one is cheap-shotted here, which makes the ultimate conclusion all the more damning. In the spirit of Barbara Tuchman's The Guns of August and Marc Bloch's Strange Defeat, To Start A War will stand as the definitive account of a collective process that arrived at evidence that would prove to be not just dubious but entirely false, driven by imagination rather than a quest for truth--evidence to drive a verdict that led to hundreds of thousands of deaths and a flood tide of chaos in the Middle East that shows no signs of ebbing""--  ""Authoritative . . . The most comprehensive account yet of that smoldering wreck of foreign policy, one that haunts us today."" -Los Angeles Times ""A timely reminder of the dangers of embarking upon wars that can imperil America itself."" -The New York Times From the author of the New York Times bestseller Dead Certain comes the definitive, revelatory reckoning with arguably the most consequential decision in the history of American foreign policy--the decision to invade Iraq.  Even now, after more than fifteen years, it is hard to see the invasion of Iraq through the cool, considered gaze of history. For too many people, the damage is still too palpable, and still unfolding. Most of the major players in that decision are still with us, and few of them are not haunted by it, in one way or another. Perhaps it's that combination, the passage of the years and the still unresolved trauma, that explains why so many protagonists opened up so fully for the first time to Robert Draper.  Draper's prodigious reporting has yielded scores of consequential new revelations, from the important to the merely absurd. As a whole, the book paints a vivid and indelible picture of a decision-making process that was fatally compromised by a combination of post-9/11 fear and paranoia, rank naïveté, craven groupthink, and a set of actors with idées fixes who gamed the process relentlessly. Everything was believed; nothing was true. The intelligence failure was comprehensive. Draper's fair-mindedness and deep understanding of the principal actors suffuse his account, as does a storytelling genius that is close to sorcery. There are no cheap shots here, which makes the ultimate conclusion all the more damning. In the spirit of Barbara Tuchman's  The Guns of August and Marc Bloch's  Strange Defeat,  To Start A War will stand as the definitive account of a collective process that arrived at evidence that would prove to be not just dubious but entirely false, driven by imagination rather than a quest for truth--evidence that was then used to justify a verdict that led to hundreds of thousands of deaths and a flood tide of chaos in the Middle East that shows no signs of ebbing.• Author: Robert Draper • ISBN:9780525561040 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-07-28",https://walmart.com/ip/7AU0Z1Y296G8,Books,/Iraq War Military History Books,$26.73,0.0,0 ratings,"['6V9L9X8MOL9L', '4E1EPIZPTKV5', '46NNYMLYM7CW', '4LUZOYVEBM41', '6C7ZL82WUBIE', '2E3BB2AI80SE', '52S6DJ85ASMS', '35QSTF3MBHVL', '6F5C7UM7J485', '583LZY0ALL7L', '2E3BB2AI80SE', '52S6DJ85ASMS', '35QSTF3MBHVL', '3B0EG3HCKKFC', '6F5C7UM7J485']"

6ILMJFVV7K64,On Corruption in America : And What Is at Stake (Hardcover),"From the prizewinning journalist, internationally recognized expert on corruption in government networks throughout the world, author of Thieves of State: Why Corruption Threatens Global Security (""I can't imagine a more important book for our time,""--Sebastian Junger; ""Required reading,""--Tom Friedman; ""compelling, fascinating . . . a call to action,""--The Huffington Post), a major, unflinching book that looks homeward to America, exploring the insidious, dangerous networks of corruption of our past, present, and precarious future. Now, bringing to bear all of her knowledge, grasp, sense of history and observation, Sarah Chayes writes in her new book ,  that the United States is showing signs similar to some of the most corrupt countries in the world. Corruption, as Chayes sees it, is an operating system of sophisticated networks in which government officials, key private-sector interests, and out-and-out criminals interweave. Their main objective: not to serve the public but to maximize returns for network members.  From the titans of America's Gilded Age (Carnegie, Rockefeller, J. P. Morgan, et al.) to the collapse of the stock market in 1929, the Great Depression and FDR's New Deal; from Joe Kennedy's years of banking, bootlegging, machine politics, and pursuit of infinite wealth, as well as the Kennedy presidency, to the deregulation of the Reagan Revolution, undermining the middle class and the unions; from the Clinton policies of political favors and personal enrichment to Trump's hydra-headed network of corruption, systematically undoing the Constitution and our laws, Chayes shows how corrupt systems are organized, how they enforce the rules so their crimes are covered legally, how they are overlooked and downplayed--shrugged off with a roll of the eyes--by the richer and better educated, how they become an overt principle determining the shape of our government, affecting all levels of society.• Author: Sarah Chayes • ISBN:9780525654858 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-08-11",https://walmart.com/ip/6ILMJFVV7K64,Books,/General United States History Books,$25.73,0.0,0 ratings,"['4R6HKYYGWUK2', '1NVV63X2XWCC', '1888UGIYYTZW', '7A4I0N32EQ81', '29PGMVZ1MFAZ', '2E3BB2AI80SE', '6U0DC1QOOAFD', '30VWREPJS09L', '30QRM4SOQ02C', '63G9HDB3PAIP', '2E3BB2AI80SE', '6U0DC1QOOAFD', '30VWREPJS09L', '30QRM4SOQ02C', '63G9HDB3PAIP']"

6W4PGPKAILEP,Legacy of Honor : The Values and Influence of America's Eagle Scouts,"10TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION ""Thanks to Legacy of Honor,  readers now have the chance to see just how Eagle Scouts have served, loved, and led America."" --Scouting magazine Over the past century, America's Eagle Scouts have earned a reputation for service, virtue, and leadership that is recognized throughout the world. But few people realize the full extent to which Eagle Scouts have made a mark on American history. They have served as astronauts, soldiers, politicians, and businessmen, but they have also been the fathers, brothers, Scoutmasters, coaches, and other role models who have played an integral part in American life.  Alvin Townley set out across the country to hear the stories of these Eagle Scouts. He spoke with individuals from every region, of every age and every background, some of whom have risen to fame as public figures, while others have left a lasting impact outside of the spotlight.  The Eagle Scouts who share their experiences include Michael Bloomberg; J. W. Marriott, Jr.; Bill Gates, Sr.; Ross Perot; Defense Secretary Robert Gates; Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson; Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer; and Capt. Jim Lovell of Apollo 13,  to name just a few. The book also explores the virtues of a Tuskegee Airman, a Vietnam War POW, a September 11 NYPD hero, a crew of Hurricane Katrina relief workers, and a host of others from every walk of life. During his journey, Alvin discovered stories of character, courage, and inspiration that belong not only to Eagle Scouts but to all Americans. These stories form the heart of Legacy of Honor and offer us a chance to appreciate the profound impact that Eagle Scouts have had on American history and the lasting role they will play in our country's future.10TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION ?Thanks to Legacy of Honor, readers now have the chance to see just how Eagle Scouts have served, loved, and led America.? ?Scouting magazine Over the past century, America?s Eagle Scouts have earned a reputation for service, virtue, and leadership that is recognized throughout the world.

45CYVHWJS5Q0,The Black Banners (Declassified) : How Torture Derailed the War on Terror After 9/11 (Edition 2) (Hardcover),"The definitive account of an FBI special agent's al-Qaeda story, unredacted for the first time.  Widely heralded on publication as a ""must-read"" (Military Review) and ""important window on America's battle with al-Qaeda"" (Washington Post), Ali Soufan's revelatory account of the war on terror as seen from its front lines changed the way we understand al-Qaeda and how the United States prosecuted the war--and led to hard questions being asked of our leaders. When The Black Banners was published in 2011, significant portions of the text were redacted. After subsequent review by the Central Intelligence Agency, those redactions have been lifted. Their removal corrects the record on how vital intelligence was obtained from al-Qaeda suspects and brings forth important new details on the controversial use of enhanced interrogation techniques (torture) to extract information from terror suspects. For many years, proponents of the use of these techniques have argued that they produced actionable intelligence in the war on terror. This edition of The Black Banners explodes this myth; it shows Soufan at work using guile and intelligent questioning--not force or violence--to extract some of the most important confessions in the war, and it vividly recounts the failures of the government's torture program. Drawing on Soufan's experiences as a lead operative for the FBI and declassified government records, The Black Banners (Declassified) documents the intelligence failures that lead to the tragic attacks on New York and Washington, DC, and subsequently how torture derailed the fight against al-Qaeda. With this edition, eighteen years on from the first sanctioned enhanced interrogation technique, the public can finally read the complete story of what happened in their name after the events of 9/11. The Black Banners (Declassified) includes a new foreword from Ali Soufan that addresses the significance of the CIA's decision to lift the redactions.• Author: Ali Soufan • ISBN:9780393540727 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-09-08",https://walmart.com/ip/45CYVHWJS5Q0,Books,/Espionage True Crime Books,$21.66,0.0,0 ratings,"['1PB344FB26H5', '6L62A96BKAX2', '33PJSX90MQPI', '23DNJUCKAIWH', '4HFQZBX73LEU', '583LZY0ALL7L', '39DTPKDHZW44', '6F5C7UM7J485', '538G140QM65S', '6ZIJU9I7ZSZP', '4E43EZ1VDTU1', '2E3BB2AI80SE', '3LMGUVQ6E6B4', '60SG07IV7XQB', '3GWAYW3IIH7R']"

It's delicious, indulgent, and never lets you down--it's everything you could want in comfort food. How many of us haven't spent an evening blissed out with a wedge of brie and a glass of wine? Creator of the Instagram sensation @ThatCheesePlate Marissa Mullen takes cheese to a whole new level with her gorgeous, show-stopping cheese plates. With her simple step-by-step Cheese by Numbers method, she breaks down the cheese plate into its basic components--cheese, meat (aka the Salami River), produce, crunch, dips, garnish--and shows you how to recreate these beautiful spreads for any occasion, whether it's a dinner party, a book club gathering, wine nights with friends, or your classy Netflix binge. But cheese plates aren't just the greatest snack ever created. They're also an important form of self-care.

78EODGC007D0,Mediterranean Cookbook: Effortless Mediterranean Diet Slow Cooker Cookbook: Easy Everyday Slow Cooker Mediterranean Recipes for a Healthy Lifestyle (Paperback),"Following the Mediterranean diet has never been this thanks to the slow cooker! You wonèt even feel you are on a diet! The slow cooker is probably one of the greatest culinary inventions of modern times. It not only allows you the freedom to go about your day without having to worry about preparing a meal; the slow cooking process makes meat more succulent and infuses your meals with bursts of flavor that can be achieved in no other way. Many people associate slow cookers with rich stews and hearty roasts, but they can also prepare food for other diets-and the Mediterranean diet is one that benefits greatly from the use of a slow cooker. The Mediterranean diet is a heart-healthy diet that eliminates added sugars, trans fat, refined grains and oils, processed meat and all highly processed food products, and a slow cooker doesn't require added oils, processed meats or refined grains to create amazing, delicious, healthy meals. Although many of these recipes may have some flour or a few other extras, they are still much healthier than standard North American cuisine. The Mediterranean diet is known to contribute to the improvement of overall health and decreased incidences of cancer and high blood pressure. The whole grains used in the recipes from this region contain few unhealthy fats, while the liberal use of nuts, avocados, salmon and tuna supplies plenty of healthy fats. The recipes in this book show you how to use your slow cooker to prepare heart-healthy Mediterranean meals for breakfast, lunch, dinner and even dessert. Snacks, appetizers, and sides are not neglected either. You'll be able to enjoy a wonderful slow-cooked side dish with a fillet of salmon-rich in omega-3 fatty acid, or toss ingredients into the slow cooker at night and wake up to warm, tasty meal to start your day. From oatmeal to tiramisu bread pudding, the recipes in this book are sure to please.  Inside, you'll find   Everything you need to know about the Mediterranean diet.   Cooking tips for using a slow cooker and how to care for your slow cooker.   Nutritious breakfast recipes such as the Breakfast Stuffed Peppers and the Slow Cooker Frittata.

And, more than anything, cooking is what Alex and her daughter, Ava, most love to do together. In  Cook with Me, Alex revives the recipes she grew up with, such as her mom's chicken with barbecue sauce and her dad's steamed pork dumplings, offers recipes for foods that she wishes she grew up with, such as comforting and cheesy baked ziti, and details dishes new to her repertoire, including sheet pan pork chops with spicy Brussels sprouts and a roasted sweet potato salad with honey and toasted pumpkin seeds. From meatballs two ways (are you a  Godfather or a  Goodfellas person?) to the blueberry crumble her mom made every summer, Alex shares recipes and insights that can come only from generations of collective experience.

5AWDSMH3KEKM,Fruit Processing (Paperback),"Fruit and fruit products, in all their many varieties and variations, are major world commodities and part of the economic life blood of many countries, particularly in the developing world. The perception of the healthy nature of fruit is a major reason for its increased consumption in the developed world, and many consumers today find a wider selection of fruit varieties, available at all times of the year, than ever before. This volume, however, is not so much concerned with fresh fruit as those principal areas of processing to which it may be subjected. Fruit processing arose as a means of utilising a short-lived product and preserving its essential nutritional qualities as far as possible. A chapter on the nutritional aspects of fruit is included in this work to reflect the importance of this topic to most consumers. After a general introduction, the chapter on fruit storage is the only contribution which deals with a process from which fruit emerges in essentially the same physical condition. Beyond that the book sets out to cover most of the major areas in which fruit may be processed into forms which bear varying semblances to the original raw material.Fruit Processing (Paperback)",https://walmart.com/ip/5AWDSMH3KEKM,Books,/General,$159.99,0.0,0 ratings,"['5WNP8K2WC64G', '4DFM9AW0ZFZR', '0YK2K3QBZL70', '1YLQCYG57WHT', '2W9B17I6LQW4', '4WSJHZB8RV5U', '33JJI4OG0D2P', '5MURM3IJWM4G', '12EL6D5PRAQM', '2YJV5NNFK7V3', '1EP5Y8CTH4NW', '5GMCTEQUWGJ8', '2AF5CY9N3HEP', '5KKDO7WPP7C5', '3JS5TUB0BCGK']"

Air fryers promise crisp fried food without actual deep frying. Was it too good to be believed? And what can you cook in them besides French fries? In truth, air fryers cook food by blasting it with circulated hot air. The method is fast, convenient, and can be surprisingly good--if you have the right recipe. We cooked more than 70 pounds of potatoes to create the perfect air fryer French fry, with an evenly crisp exterior and creamy center. But what really drew us to this appliance was the variety of what you can make in it, effortlessly and without having to enlist numerous pots and pans.  In addition to crispy fried chicken and fries, you'll turn out evenly cooked steaks, such as Spice-Rubbed Steak with Snap Pea and Cucumber Salad (the spice rub gives them a bold crust), Sweet and Smoky Pork Tenderloin with Roasted Butternut Squash (the pork cooks directly on top of the squash to save time), and Tandoori Chicken Thighs. Many of the recipes yield both a main and a side for a complete meal. Most recipes take only 45 minutes or even less time, and all come with complete nutrition information.  Frozen foods cook up crisp in the air fryer, but the results are so much better when you start with homemade. So we offer freeze-it-yourself Chicken Nuggets, Southwestern Beef Hand Pies, and more that go straight from freezer to air fryer and cook to perfection. And we share plenty of kid-friendly meals and snacks, from Better-Than-Boxed Fish Sticks to Zucchini Fries.Get the best possible results from your air fryer and discover the best ways to use it (not just frying!) with 75 fast, convenient, great-tasting recipes.

2LA9JP0YZTKN,The Mexican Keto Cookbook 2 : 50 Easy Mexican Keto Recipes. Add Some Spicy To Your Diet And Prepare To Lose Your Weight Fast (Paperback),"This book will help you to enjoy Mexican cuisine, treat yourself to spicy dishes and at the same time, effectively lose weight. Mexican cuisine is very diverse and incredibly tasty. Most of the recipes in this book can be cooked by beginners, since the book describes in details each stage of cooking. The peculiarity of the keto diet is that a person loses weight due to fat loss. That is, unlike most popular diets, muscle mass in people who observe this principle of nutrition remains the same. Essential in a keto diet are fats that make up to 75% of the diet. Then follow proteins - 20%. Finally, carbohydrates, whose amount is 5% of the total mass of products. It means that your diet should include avocado, fish, meat, seafood, eggs, nuts, and high-fat dairy products. Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the body. When their level in the body diminishes, this triggers an active processing of fats. The diet does not limit the time of eating to the standard 18:00 - you can eat at any time, but, of course, within reasonable limits.

5FIB9VZX622C,Alton Brown's Gear for Your Kitchen,"This essential book for any fan of Brown--and anyone who wants a good guide to great kitchen gear--reveals everything from the invention of the ""blendor"" (that's the way its inventor spelled it) to the true facts behind kitchen urban legends.Dedicated viewers of Alton Brown's acclaimed Food Network show  Good Eats know of his penchant for using unusual equipment. He has smoked a salmon in a cardboard box, roasted prime rib in a flowerpot, and used a C-clamp as a nutcracker. Brown isn't interested in novelty, he's just devoted to using the best--and simplest--tool for the job.   Alton Brown's Gear For Your Kitchen offers honest, practical advice on what's needed and what isn't, what works and what doesn't. For instance: You only need three knives, but they are a lifetime investment. And don't bother with that famous countertop grill--it doesn't get hot enough to properly sear. In his signature science-guy style, Brown begins with advice on kitchen layout and organization, then gets to the lowdown on these cooking elements: Big Things with Plugs; Pots and Pans; Sharp Things; The Tool Box; Small Things with Plugs; Storage and Containment; and Safety and Sanitation.   Gear For Your Kitchen is essential for all of Brown's fans as well as anyone who wants a good guide to great kitchen gear.

Other than this, it also kills harmful bacteria,  helps you save energy, and preserves the taste of food. If you are not armed with the best culinary skill, expect instant pot to save you when you need it.  And if you would look at it, this changing of the lid transforms everything in your appliance. And to top that, you are well shielded from making any kind of mistake of mixing up the functions. Because you cannot operate the pressure cooker with the air fryer lid resting on the top of the appliance. And the same goes for when you are using it as a pressure cooker.  Maintaining a healthy weight and keeping yourself fit and healthy need not be a herculean task. You can have a simple solution - what goes in is what comes out. Ultimately what is getting stored in your body is the food that you feed your body. I go by the famous quotes of Hippocrates:  ""Let food be your medicine and let medicine be your food."" Here onward, I started my experiments with food. The love for healthy eating made me take up a short-term course in Nutrition & Dietetics. Exploring more on food and cooking, I realized that cooking is both an art and science. Food should be tasty to tempt the family, including the picky eaters. At the same time, it should cook in a way by minimizing the presence of unhealthy fats while retaining healthy fats and nutritional values.  This book covers the following topics:   The Instant Pot Duo Crisp Air Fryer Secrets Quick-To-Make Method Air Fryer Fats Breakfast and Brunch Poultry Fish and Seafood Beef Lamb and Pork Vegan, Keto and Vegetarian Snacks and Appetizer Dessert More than 100 NEW Recipes  ...And much more Instant Pot Duo Air Crisp barely takes a few minutes to get everything done. It is both time and energy-efficient. Once the food is cooked, the appliance switches to this ""keep warm"" mode, and minimum heat are used to keep the food fresh.  Forget about the days when you used to switch between different appliances. The best feature of this appliance is that it is so simple and easy to convert it from one form to another. There are two different lids that can be used to carry out a range of different functions. The pressure-cooking lid is used for pressure cooking modes, and with Air frying lid, you can bake, air fry and roast, etc.  Since the design is the same and as simple as the original Instant Pot pressure cooker series, the user wouldn't find much difficulty in understanding its control panel and its use. All button is labeled with their respective functions and the LED screen guides about the on-going operations.

Discover how to unlock new depths of flavor by  pairing vegetables with sweetness, fat, acidity, or chile heat, and learn to identify the  produce that has the innate ability to make dishes shine.  With main courses, sides, desserts, and a whole pantry of ""flavor bombs"" (homemade condiments), there's something for any meal, any night of the week, including surefire hits such as Stuffed Eggplant in Curry and Coconut Dal, Spicy Mushroom Lasagne, and Romano Pepper Schnitzels. Chock-full of low-effort, high-impact dishes that pack a punch and standout meals for the relaxed cook,  Ottolenghi Flavor is a revolutionary approach to vegetable cooking.• Author: Yotam Ottolenghi,Ixta Belfrage • ISBN:9780399581755 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-10-13",https://walmart.com/ip/1LUSGWRTQAL6,Gifts & Registry,/Gift Finder,$25.43,0.0,0 ratings,"['5ZMQ93OFUDNT', '6NKF0RK9GHL5', '5DFK50DMDO8X', '37MV7SIG569Z', '4KOTOAEJRAUQ', '2CSVHTPT3EWD', '454R07AVCJKI', '6PSXHKB3ZQG7', '4OT67VQXUG8M']"

We want to tell the tale about potion making. The subtle science and exact art of potion-making (that's ""bartending,"" to Muggles) is difficult, but it can be mastered. According to Professor Snape, a good potion can ""bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses."" You can ""bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death,"" if you know what you're doing.

So here are some recipes that will get you drunk, honor the wizard within, and hopefully earn you some serious house points. No wands or cauldrons necessary to make these Harry Potter alcoholic drinks!  One of the most magical things about the JK Rowling series is how very believable the food and drinks sound. No doubt about it, the Wizarding World is a foodie paradise. And while countless muggles have tried to recreate the drinks, we've got secret recipes that rival even those of the Harry Potter Restaurant - and you won't need an Ollivanders magic wand to pull them off. So, round up your gang of wizards and muggles, and prepare for some serious mixologist sorcery. Here are 41 Harry Potter cocktails that will teleport you to the heart at the Hogshead Pub without the magic of Floo Powder.

64BKG205UCO5,Mark Gonzales (Hardcover),"Named the ""Most Influential Skateboarder of All Time"" by Transworld Skateboarding, Mark Gonzales aka The Gonz is one of the most recognizable names in skateboarding, art, and street style. Born in California in 1968, Gonzales entered the skateboarding world at age 13, and by 16, was featured on the cover of Thrasher magazine. Widely revered since then as the inventor of street skating, Gonzales has remained one of the most prolific innovators in both skateboarding and contemporary art. Part skate photography, part intimate portrait, this is a bold collection of work straight from the mind of the artist, as seen through Sem Rubio's iconic photography. After working together for over a decade, Rubio and Gonzales have created an impressive archive that became the seed for this stunning monograph. Hailed for a sense of fearlessness and creativity, Gonzales has always had a way of changing the game, whether through his inventive skateboarding or his creative art and writing. His long-standing collaborations with brands including Adidas, Supreme, Thrasher, RETROSUPERFUTURE, JanSport, and Études, gathered together for the first time in this volume, showcase a rebellious vision that has cemented his place in both skateboard and pop culture history.  This indispensable volume gathers new, personal insights into legendary tricks and collaborations. It is a verbal and visual testimony of his many worlds. Specially-commissioned interviews with Spike Jonze, Hiroshi Fujiwara, KAWS, Ed Templeton, Tommy Guerrero, Tony Hawk, Blondey McCoy, Gus Van Sant and more are peppered throughout the book, making this a truly kaleidoscopic portrait of the ever-evolving, revolutionary artist.• Author: Mark Gonzales • ISBN:9780847868704 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-09-22",https://walmart.com/ip/64BKG205UCO5,Books,/Street Photography Books,$42.63,0.0,0 ratings,"['12Z86M677YAG', '5NPVTNGE5EV8', '27B1Z3JVIAS2', '7JV97RJD7S81', '1H5XZ7YGO4Y2', '12Z86M677YAG', '5NPVTNGE5EV8', '27B1Z3JVIAS2', '7JV97RJD7S81', '1H5XZ7YGO4Y2']"

The CD for this book offers a unique listening experience with outstanding orchestrations and vocals. The recordings demonstrate a key principle of the course: when children listen, sing, tap, and move to their piano music, they play more musically.

3N56HNGAP7XZ,Why Bob Dylan Matters (Paperback),"""The coolest class on campus"" - The New York Times When the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Bob Dylan in 2016, a debate raged. Some celebrated, while many others questioned the choice. How could the world's most prestigious book prize be awarded to a famously cantankerous singer-songwriter who wouldn't even deign to attend the medal ceremony? In Why Bob Dylan Matters, Harvard Professor Richard F. Thomas answers this question with magisterial erudition. A world expert on Classical poetry, Thomas was initially ridiculed by his colleagues for teaching a course on Bob Dylan alongside his traditional seminars on Homer, Virgil, and Ovid. Dylan's Nobel Prize brought him vindication, and he immediately found himself thrust into the spotlight as a leading academic voice in all matters Dylanological. Today, through his wildly popular Dylan seminar--affectionately dubbed ""Dylan 101""--Thomas is introducing a new generation of fans and scholars to the revered bard's work.  This witty, personal volume is a distillation of Thomas's famous course, and makes a compelling case for moving Dylan out of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and into the pantheon of Classical poets. Asking us to reflect on the question, ""What makes a classic?"", Thomas offers an eloquent argument for Dylan's modern relevance, while interpreting and decoding Dylan's lyrics for readers. The most original and compelling volume on Dylan in decades, Why Bob Dylan Matters will illuminate Dylan's work for the Dylan neophyte and the seasoned fanatic alike. You'll never think about Bob Dylan in the same way again.  ""The coolest class on campus"" - The New York Times When the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Bob Dylan in 2016, a debate raged.

5K0TMQUXSQXT,Let Love Rule (Hardcover),"""I see my story as a suite of songs that have a magical connection. I never understood that connection until I sat down to write. It was then that the magic started to flow.""Let Love Rule is a work of deep reflection. Lenny Kravitz looks back at his life with candor, self-scrutiny, and humor.  ""My life is all about opposites,"" he writes. ""Black and white. Jewish and Christian. The Jackson 5 and Led Zeppelin. I accepted my Gemini soul. I owned it. I adored it. Yins and yangs mingled in various parts of my heart and mind, giving me balance and fueling my curiosity and comfort.""   Let Love Rule covers a vast canvas stretching from Manhattan's Upper East Side, Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant, Los Angeles's Baldwin Hills, Beverly Hills, and finally to France, England and Germany.  It's the story of a wildly creative kid who, despite tough struggles at school and extreme tension at home, finds salvation in music.  We see him grow as a musician and ultimately a master songwriter, producer, and performer. We also see Lenny's spiritual growth--and the powerful way in which spirit informs his music.  The cast of characters surrounding Lenny is extraordinary: his father, Sy, a high-powered news executive; his mother, Roxie Roker, a television star; and Lisa Bonet, the young actress who becomes his muse.  The central character, of course, is Lenny, who, despite his great aspirational energy, turns down record deal after record deal until he finds his true voice.  The creation of that voice, the same voice that is able to declare ""Let Love Rule"" to an international audience, is the very heart of this story.  ""Whether recording, performing, or writing a book,"" says Lenny, ""my art is about listening to the inspiration inside and then sharing it with people. Art must bring the world closer together."" • Author: Lenny Kravitz • ISBN:9781250113085 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-10-06",https://walmart.com/ip/5K0TMQUXSQXT,Books,/Composers & Musicians Biographies & Memoirs,$17.99,0.0,0 ratings,"['1NAB4PLXEFS8', '7FF711SQUSRP', '1CDDZW1BBCVC', '1FL331Y9VFJV', '638KLBWCH90H', '40VL2AXAPV5V', '5FBI30XVQRG6', '4S5R6N1XEC5G', '74KFQJP0776X', '5RSIWIXH1QQW', '5FBI30XVQRG6', '40VL2AXAPV5V', '4S5R6N1XEC5G', '74KFQJP0776X', '5RSIWIXH1QQW']"
7IDKITD5QA2R,Philip Guston Now (Hardcover),"""The exhibition is organized by the National Gallery of Art, Washington; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; Tate Modern, London; and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston""--Copyright page.  A sweeping retrospective of Philip Guston's influential work, from Depression-era muralist to abstract expressionist to tragicomic contemporary master Philip Guston--perhaps more than any other figure in recent memory--has given contemporary artists permission to break the rules and paint what, and how, they want. His winding career, embrace of ""high"" and ""low"" sources, and constant aesthetic reinvention defy easy categorization, and his 1968 figurative turn is by now one of modern art's most legendary conversion narratives. ""I was feeling split, schizophrenic. The war, what was happening in America, the brutality of the world. What kind of man am I, sitting at home, reading magazines, going into a frustrated fury about everything--and then going into my studio to adjust a red to a blue?""  And so Guston's sensitive abstractions gave way to large, cartoonlike canvases populated by lumpy, sometimes tortured figures and mysterious personal symbols in a palette of juicy pinks, acid greens, and cool blues. That Guston continued mining this vein for the rest of his life--despite initial bewilderment from his peers--reinforced his reputation as an artist's artist and a model of integrity; since his death 50 years ago, he has become hugely influential as contemporary art has followed Guston into its own antic twists and turns.  Published to accompany the first retrospective museum exhibition of Guston's career in over 15 years,  Philip Guston Now includes a lead essay by Harry Cooper surveying Guston's life and work, and a definitive chronology reflecting many new discoveries. It also highlights the voices of artists of our day who have been inspired by the full range of his work: Tacita Dean, Peter Fischli, Trenton Doyle Hancock, William Kentridge, Glenn Ligon, David Reed, Dana Schutz, Amy Sillman, Art Spiegelman and Rirkrit Tiravanija. Thematic essays by co-curators Mark Godfrey, Alison de Lima Greene and Kate Nesin trace the influences, interests and evolution of this singular force in modern and contemporary art--including several perspectives on the 1960s and '70s, when Guston gradually abandoned abstraction, returning to the figure and to current history but with a personal voice, by turns comic and apocalyptic, that resonates today more than ever. • ISBN:9781942884569 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-06-02",https://walmart.com/ip/7IDKITD5QA2R,Books,"/Collections, Catalogs & Exhibitions Art Books",$51.54,0.0,0 ratings,"['4T232Q5ZXOEC', '3GGIX2CBMLKH', '1CA3GUOHKSDH', '31WPCPUNOUDF', '7LDCKTJDNO6C', '12Z86M677YAG', '5NPVTNGE5EV8', '27B1Z3JVIAS2', '7JV97RJD7S81', '46RBXKVNJVQX', '7JV97RJD7S81', '27B1Z3JVIAS2', '5NPVTNGE5EV8', '12Z86M677YAG', '46RBXKVNJVQX']"

Returning to the Irish town of his youth, he purchases the home of his birth and finds happiness when he falls in love with the fiery Mary Kate (Maureen O'Hara). But her insistence that Sean conduct his courtship in a proper Irish manner with matchmaker Barry Fitzgerald along for the ride as chaperone is but one obstacle to their future happiness: The other is her brother (Victor McLaglen), who spitefully refuses to give his consent to their marriage, or to honor the tradition of paying a dowry to the husband. Sean could care less about dowries, he would've punched out the bullying McLaglen long ago if he hadn't sworn off fighting. But when Mary Kate accuses him of being a coward and walks out on him, Sean is finally ready to take matters into his own hands, the resulting fistfight erupts into the longest brawl ever filmed, followed by one of the most memorable reconciliations in movie history!

I only took the meeting because I was curious. I thought he was going to offer me a job. But that's not what he's after at all. His proposal is much more intriguing, and I see an opportunity. An opportunity to turn the tables and bring down the devil. I've gotten in trouble playing these games before. I know when the risk is too great, when the stakes are too high.

The surrogate he hired to carry his and his late wife's child has gone missing and the wrong woman is inseminated. There weren't supposed to be loose ends in this transaction, but it's turning into a zero-sum game he can't afford to lose.  Artist Winter Alexander has painted a perfect picture for her life. But when a routine procedure results in an accidental pregnancy, the realistic portrait she painted turns surreal. It's an error she can't brush away with a tube of titanium-white, no matter how much she might want to. Especially not when the Grayson is determined she become his substitute surrogate.  To Grayson, Winter is an abstract piece, a collection of soulful shapes and swirls he's hopelessly mesmerized by. One he wouldn't have envisioned in his life before. Winter finds Grayson controlling at first, but beneath those cold eyes lies a longing, a torch of desire and vulnerability that makes her agree to things she'd never considered.  They embark on a 40-week journey in the name of a child, navigating through a sea of self-doubt, conflicting emotions and rising feelings. When these nine months are over, will Grayson be able to convince Winter to make him and the baby part of her picture-perfect landscape? What happens next is something neither of them sees coming.

This exquisitely written Regency will appeal to Balogh’s legions of fans.” —Publishers Weekly (starred review)     “A heroine who has never felt valued and a hero in search of a new purpose learn to take life as it comes and live each moment to the fullest.

394QUFZ4RHQV,Rush Across the Decades: Limelight: Rush in the '80s (Series #2) (Hardcover),"This three-part series celebrates Canada's iconic rock band, offering the most comprehensive biography ever, combining cultural context and canon analysis. All based on extensive firsthand interviews with family, friends, musicians, and the boys in the band. Book two covers the height of Rush's popularity and is a look at all their 1980s albums.  Part two of the definitive biography of the rock 'n' roll kings of the North -- covering Rush's most iconic and popular albums, Moving Pictures and Power Windows Includes two full-color photo inserts, with 16 pages of the band on tour and in the studio In the follow-up to Anthem: Rush in the '70s, Martin Popoff brings together canon analysis, cultural context, and extensive firsthand interviews to celebrate Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, and Neil Peart at the peak of their persuasive power. Rush was one of the most celebrated hard rock acts of the '80s, and the second book of Popoff's staggeringly comprehensive three-part series takes readers from Permanent Waves to Presto, while bringing new insight to Moving Pictures, their crowning glory. Limelight: Rush in the '80s is a celebration of fame, of the pushback against that fame, of fortunes made -- and spent ... In the latter half of the decade, as Rush adopts keyboard technology and gets pert and poppy, there's an uproar amongst diehards, but the band finds a whole new crop of listeners. Limelight charts a dizzying period in the band's career, built of explosive excitement but also exhaustion, a state that would lead, as the '90s dawned, to the band questioning everything they previously believed, and each member eying the oncoming decade with trepidation and suspicion.• Author: Martin Popoff • ISBN:9781770415362 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-10-13",https://walmart.com/ip/394QUFZ4RHQV,Books,/Composers & Musicians Biographies & Memoirs,$24.72,0.0,0 ratings,"['1NAB4PLXEFS8', '7FF711SQUSRP', '1CDDZW1BBCVC', '1FL331Y9VFJV', '638KLBWCH90H', '39DTPKDHZW44', '665G0YTR9R0J', '26VWTTA4KZL4', '7B770WSUNVM1', '14V7CY3U6ZVM', '39DTPKDHZW44', '665G0YTR9R0J', '7B770WSUNVM1', '26VWTTA4KZL4', '14V7CY3U6ZVM']"

7HEPEVMLZ7TY,Fire Cannot Kill a Dragon : Game of Thrones and the Official Untold Story of the Epic Series (Hardcover),"""The official, definitive oral history of the blockbuster show from Entertainment Weekly's James Hibberd, published with HBO's official support""--  Praise from George R.R. Martin:   James Hibberd covered  Game of Thrones from start to finish, and he knows where all the bodies are buried. It's all here, in his oral history of the series: how it began, how it ended, dragons and direwolves, what went on in front of the cameras and what went on behind the scenes, the triumphs and the stumbles, the tough decisions, the forks in the road, the reasons why. Actors, directors, showrunners, producers, executives, even me...  Fire Cannot Kill a Dragon has it all, everything you ever wanted to know.  Game of Thrones was an amazing ride.  Fire Cannot Kill a Dragon is an amazing read.""   The official, definitive oral history of the blockbuster show from  Entertainment Weekly 's James Hibberd.   It was supposed to be impossible. George R.R. Martin was a frustrated television writer who created his bestselling  A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy novels to be an unfilmable saga bound only by the limits of his vast imagination. Then a pair of first-time TV writers teamed with HBO to try and adapt Martin's epic. We've all seen the eight seasons of the Emmy-winning fantasy series that came next. But there is one  Game of Thrones tale that has yet to be told: the 13-year behind-the-scenes struggle to pull off this extraordinary phenomenon.   In  Fire Cannot Kill a Dragon, award-winning  Entertainment Weekly writer James Hibberd chronicles the untold and uncensored story of  Game of Thrones, from the creative team's first meetings to staging the series finale and all the on-camera battles and off-camera struggles in between. The book draws from more than 50 revealing new interviews, rare and stunning photos, and unprecedented access to the producers, cast, and crew who took an impossible idea and made it into the biggest show in the world.• Author: James Hibberd • ISBN:9781524746759 • Format:Hardcover • Publication Date:2020-10-06",https://walmart.com/ip/7HEPEVMLZ7TY,Shop by TV Show,/Game of Thrones Books,$24.39,0.0,0 ratings,"['3D78O42ECL15', '4TZ7Y2EFZYVS', '4FM1Z2QBDQ06', '3BFVVGHSXP01', '637WTIHB87KX']"

The B and B, a place she'd always found refuge in when it seemed like the whole world was against her, has fallen into disrepair. When a surprising benefactor encourages Vashti to reopen the B and B, Vashti embraces a fresh start, and soon old hurts begin to fade as she makes new memories with the town--and its handsome sheriff...  But some pasts are too big to escape, and when a bombshell of a secret changes everything she thought was true, Vashti is left reeling. With Sawyer and his teenage daughter determined to see her through the storm, though, she's learning family isn't always a matter of blood--sometimes it's a matter of heart.• Author: Brenda Jackson • ISBN:9781335005649 • Format:Paperback • Publication Date:2018-10-30",https://walmart.com/ip/68091PX2BZFN,Books,/Contemporary Romance Books,$5.98,4.5,2 ratings,"['3Q4PTCESO1HK', '235N04KYYBY0', '3ZWNIVRBJRD0', '1KC0DO74T5B7', '2YNLPTIMVN5E', '0W3DYJV8CA9V', '3AP6HWVBBY04', '41N1KVSAHIIS', '5G2V00RL3QZ5', '72Q8N0359TWJ', '4CM7HTZMB6MA', '516QGJQ74E0N', '28VK59K6TGKW', '5O0DR3CVVC0Y', '0SXSFRYHACIU', '75CU8FUCX6EE', '6YNLWO1GIRJB', '26NL02AJ3JWH', '5RSIWIXH1QQW', '6MF6BD26BUYS', '2OI5VI35DA4X', '3LMGUVQ6E6B4', '6MF6BD26BUYS', '22WX658JEFAQ', '6QMJPQD4IN5U']"

5KT75O36D2BO,At First Sight,"In this #1 New York Times bestselling follow-up to True Believer, a young couple's love faces the ultimate test when the past disrupts the life and family they've built together. There are a few things Jeremy Marsh was sure he'd never do: he'd never leave New York City; never give his heart away again after barely surviving one failed marriage; and, most of all, never become a parent. Now, Jeremy is living in the tiny town of Boone Creek, North Carolina, married to Lexie Darnell, the love of his life, and anticipating the birth of their daughter. But just as his life seems to be settling into a blissful pattern, an unsettling and mysterious message re-opens old wounds and sets off a chain of events that will forever change the course of this young couple's marriage.  Dramatic, heartbreaking and surprising, this is a story about the love between a man and a woman and between a parent and a child. More than that, it is a story that beautifully portrays how the same emotion that can break your heart is also the one that will ultimately heal it.  While the novel picks up the tale of Lexie Darnell and Jeremy Marsh that started in  True Believer and will delight fans of that novel, it stands on its own as one of Nicholas Sparks's most deeply moving love stories.In this #1 New York Times bestselling follow-up to True Believer, a young couple's love faces the ultimate test when the past disrupts the life and family they've built together.

Although the Amish don't normally allow animals in their homes, a big, fat, orange barn cat keeps coming into Emma's house. She shoos the cat away, but it continues to appear in her house, settling on Henry's favorite wingchair. But the cat isn't the only Christmas visitor: a group of young people help bring the Christmas spirit to Emma, reminding her that love and hope abide.
